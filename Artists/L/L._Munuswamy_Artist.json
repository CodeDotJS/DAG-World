    "name": "L. Munuswamy",
    "year": "1934 - 2020",
    "intro": "A dynamic artist, intellectual, and educator, L. Munuswamy was a prominent practitioner within the Madras Art Movement who made abstraction a personal language in his artistic vocabulary.",
    "bio": "What made Munuswamy's works appealing was their international character, his individualistic vision and single-minded pursuit in his artistic endeavours. Regarded as innovative and experimental, the introvert artist had a highly representative career, particularly when seen in the context of India in the 1950s.\nIt was a decade when abstraction was seen as a movement, when the post-Independence milieu was marked by economic and cultural progress, growth of patronage from commercial houses, galleries, institutions, collectors, and foreign visitors.\nBelonging to a family of idol-makers, Munuswamy joined Government School of Art and Craft, Madras, on the insistence of his grandfather in 1956, graduating with a diploma in painting in 1961. He joined the faculty as a teacher\u2014later appointed its principal\u2014in 1971, retiring from the post in 1986. As a student, Munuswamy was mentored by three distinctive personalities\u2014D. P. Roy Chowdhury, S. Dhanapal and K. C. S. Paniker\u2014all of whom impacted his art profoundly.\nHis engagement with line, colour and space led him to consciously choose the language of abstraction, indirectly allowing the regional character a meaningful role. Setting his gaze on the human form to mediate his abstract expressions, Munuswamy\u2019s artistic language remains unparalleled.",
