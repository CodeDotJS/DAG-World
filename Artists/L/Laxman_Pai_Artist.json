    "name": "Laxman Pai",
    "year": "1926 - 2021",
    "intro": "The artist from Goa who brought alive the lush landscape and vibrant life of his home state in his canvases, Laxman Pai studied and later taught at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay.",
    "bio": "Born in Margao, Goa, on 21 January 1926, Pai participated in Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Satyagraha movement against the British rule that led to his imprisonment. Later, he participated in the movement to liberate Goa from centuries of Portuguese rule.\nYet, it was not the political climate of his youth but Goa that remained a source of inspiration for him. A contemporary of the other renowned artist from Goa\u2014F. N. Souza\u2014Pai gave expression to life\u2019s experiences in his canvases with vigour and a richness of colour, but devoid of any commentary or moralistic narrative.\nHe called himself his own guru, creating a highly individual vocabulary, which was accentuated during his ten-year stay in Paris. Influenced by the works of Paul Klee, Mark Chagall, and Joan Mir\u00f3, Pai created an eclectic intermingling of the traditional and the modern in his work. He explored the stylisation of Indian folk art with modern techniques such as angular simplification and flatness of the pictorial surface.\nUpon his return from Paris, Pai served as the principal of the Goa College of Art (1977-87). He won many prestigious honours, such as the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1961 and 1963; Gomant Vibhushan Award, the highest civilian award of the Goa government; and the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan from the government of India, among others. He passed away in Dona Paula, Goa, on 14 March 2021.",
