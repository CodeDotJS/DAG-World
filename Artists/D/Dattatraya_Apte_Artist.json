    "intro": "Born on 11 April 1953 in Sangli, Maharashtra, Dattatraya Apte grew up in a culturally-charged household.",
    "bio": "Apte's father was a teacher and used to make Ganehsa idols for puja at home, a skill that young Apte learnt early on. He also learnt to paint photographs and retouch negatives with an uncle who was a photographer.\nThough Apte enrolled at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, to study sculpture, he eventually trained at Pune\u2019s Abhinav Kala Vidyalaya. He next went to M. S. University, Baroda, for a post diploma in printmaking that he obtained in 1980. \nMaps and cartography are a strong presence in Apte\u2019s prints, which stand out for his emphasis on texture, often resulting in relief-like effects. J. D. Gondharekar, former dean of Sir J. J. School of Art, was an early inspiration to whom Apte credits his series of works on monuments and historical ruins. He looked up to K. G. Subramanyan for his spontaneity, and Jeram Patel for his intensity.   \nBesides printmaking, Apte also works with paper pulp for the surprise it offers while being cast. He has taught printmaking at various workshops in\u00a0India, Nepal and\u00a0France, and curated several graphic print exhibitions. He won the 1992\u00a0Chitrakala\u00a0Parishad award\u202fin\u202fBangalore, and the\u202f1999\u202fCharles Wallace India Trust award to work under Prof.\u00a0Jaky\u00a0Pery\u00a0at Glasgow School of Art, Scotland. He won the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 2004, and lives and works in New Delhi.\nMaps and cartography are a strong presence in Apte\u2019s prints, which stand out for his emphasis on texture, often resulting in relief-like effects.
