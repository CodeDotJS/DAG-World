    "name": "Dhanraj Bhagat",
    "year": "1917 - 1988",
    "intro": "Born in Lahore in British India, Dhanraj Bhagat acquired a diploma in sculpture from the city\u2019s Mayo College of Art.",
    "bio": "Bhagat began working with clay while studying but it left him uninspired as he found little individuality in its amorphous nature. It was when he got his hands on wood with its uniquely tactile qualities that he felt inspired to carve and create.\nBhagat\u2019s early wood sculptures bore liquid, stream-like forms of the sensual feminine, with smooth, elongated lines charged by lyricism and the sensitivity of a young man not yet traumatised by the horrors of Partition. Post the cataclysmic event, the artist\u2019s oeuvre started acquiring rough edges and un-smoothed chisel marks. Deeply moving, these works are charged with the intensity of Bhagat\u2019s experience as a Partition refugee.\nIn the 1950s, when Bhagat had settled in Delhi, he began experimenting with different mediums such as cement, papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, aluminium, copper and brass, the inherent qualities of each suggesting to him new forms and contexts. His female figures became large and heavy, steeped in sorrow, far from the earlier, lyrical and smooth wooden ones.\nA series of mostly large, powerful sculptures executed in concrete marked his evolution towards abstraction. He won many accolades such as the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1961, the Sahitya Kala Parishad award in 1969, and the Padma Shri by the Indian government in 1977. He taught at the College of Art, New Delhi, from 1947-77, and breathed his last in 1988.",
