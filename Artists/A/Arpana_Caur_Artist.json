She was exposed to the literary world through her mother, the renowned Punjabi writer Ajeet Cour, with path-breaking female writers such as Amrita Pritam and Krishna Sobti a regular presence at her home.\nMysticism is a strong leitmotif of her work, translating on to the canvas literary tropes such as mystic/religious thought and devotional poetry, the most known example of which is her series on Sufi saints. Caur has responded to political events like the Hiroshima bombing, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, and violence against women, although it is the daily world of women that forms her frequent subject.

Along with her mother, she is the co-founder of Academy of Fine Arts and Literature, which supports the education of one hundred and fifty girls from underprivileged backgrounds, through her paintings. \nShe lives and works in New Delhi.\nMysticism is a strong leitmotif of her work, translating on to the canvas literary tropes such as mystic/religious thought and devotional poetry, the most known example of which is her series on Sufi saints.
