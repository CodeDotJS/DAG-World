    "bio": "Young Rahiman helped his father in decorating the borders of the Quranic manuscripts. He was sent to learn Persian from a scholar who also taught the language to the English resident\u2019s family in Kolhapur. He accompanied the teacher to the resident\u2019s house and, in spare time, made drawings which impressed the resident\u2019s wife. She helped him secure a scholarship from the Kolhapur ruler to study at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay.\nRahiman studied drawing, and watercolour and oil painting, graduating in 1888. While still a student, he won the prestigious Viceroy\u2019s gold medal in 1886 for a set of works which continue to be in the collection of his alma mater. \nHe returned to Kolhapur after his studies and was appointed the court painter. Rahiman travelled extensively with his royal patron, painting landscapes on location, often during different times of the day to capture the variation in light; he also made several portraits of the royals, his own family members, and common people. He painted in various mediums but preferred watercolours. \nRahiman built his career in Kolhapur but regularly participated in the exhibitions of the Bombay Art Society. His works are part of important collections. Rahiman passed away on 28 December 1931.\nRahiman studied drawing, and watercolour and oil painting, graduating in 1888.
