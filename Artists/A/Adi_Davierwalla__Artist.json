    "name": "Adi Davierwalla",
    "year": "1922 - 1975",
    "intro": "Born in 1922, pioneering modernist sculptor Ardeshir M. Davierwalla\u2014fondly called Adi\u2014was a pharmaceutical chemist by training.",
    "bio": "Davierwalla went to school in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu, and studied pharmaceutical engineering at the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute (now known as the Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute) in Bombay.\nAfter his studies, Davierwalla worked at the Continental Drug Company but gave up the job three years after holding his first show in 1956, to devote himself fulltime to art.A self-trained artist, Davierwalla learnt the basics from noted sculptor N. G. Pansare. Choosing not to work with moulds, he took to carving directly in wood, lead, steel, and stone. Inspired by ancient Indian sculpture, Western myth, and the grandeur and mystery of the Christ themes, his works like\u00a0The Foundling,\u00a0Oedipus Rex,\u00a0and\u00a0Judas,\u00a0are proof of such influence. Many of his later works acquired a more abstract vocabulary, echoing the language of twentieth century greats such as British sculptors Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, and Jacob Epstein. His stay in New York in 1968 on a John D. Rockefeller III Fund grant, to which he was nominated by Akbar Padamsee, further chiselled his modernist language.\u00a0\nWith the use of contemporary and unconventional materials, his abstract works aimed at a fusion of the geometrical and the metaphysical.\u00a0He made several large works on commission and counted scientist Dr. Homi J. Bhabha as a patron. He passed away at the age of fifty-three in Bombay.\nA self-trained artist, Davierwalla learnt the basics from noted sculptor N. G. Pansare.
