    "bio": "Close association with the Art Society of India and the Bombay Art Society brought him early recognition, laying the foundation for an illustrious career with over forty solo shows in his  lifetime.\nAlmelkar\u2019s landscapes were inspired by the works of Walter Langhammer, N. S. Bendre and European art. In his naturalistic and figurative works, he incorporated folk motifs as well as details in the miniature tradition. Coupled with experiments with modernistic elements, he evolved a style uniquely his own. \nAlmelkar\u2019s subjects comprised ordinary people, fishermen and tribal communities, set in the backdrop of their hand-painted homes with elaborate motifs. He was known to have made frequent trips to the jungles of Maharashtra, painting the flora and fauna and local communities of those forests. \nMuch feted, Almelkar won the Governor\u2019s Award of the Bombay Art Society in 1948, the Society\u2019s gold medal in 1954, Art Society of India award in 1955, and the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1956 and 1960; in all, he won twenty gold medals and twenty-four silver medals. His works were displayed in exhibitions in India, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Ceylon. \r\nHe served as the principal of a private art school, the Nutan Kala Mandir in Bangalore, before joining his alma mater as lecturer in 1968. He passed away in December 1982.\nAlmelkar\u2019s landscapes were inspired by the works of Walter Langhammer, N. S. Bendre and European art.
