    "intro": "Born in Sindgi, Karnataka, Iranna G. Rukumpur, popularly known as G. R. Iranna, grew up on his father\u2019s farm, worked in the fields, and studied in Sarang Math (a traditional village school or an ashram) where he discovered his early interest in drawing and painting.",
    "bio": "As a child, freshly laid-out roads were Iranna\u2019s earliest canvases on which he drew images of Hanuman, the monkey-god, with chalk.\nEarly encouragement from his guru in the ashram allowed Iranna to pursue art as a lifetime commitment. He graduated from College of Visual Art, Gulbarga, in 1992. Later, in 1994, he received his master\u2019s in fine arts from the College of Art, New Delhi. In 1999, he was awarded the Charles Wallace scholarship by the British Council, which took him to Wimbledon School of Art, London.\nThe artist works in various mediums, propelling him to understand the meditative quality and the language of each medium. Iranna\u2019s art is a homage to the childhood lived in the village: \u2018The deeper impressions of form come through your seeing in childhood,\u2019 he said.\nFrom small pastels and drawings to large diptychs, lithographs, and majestic sculptures in bronze, Iranna\u2019s art, experimented on various surfaces and mediums, closely studies the complexities of people, their fates, their power\u2014or powerlessness\u2014and their struggles.\r\nThe artist lives and works in New Delhi with his wife and fellow artist, Pooja Iranna.",
