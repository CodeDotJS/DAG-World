    "name": "G. R. Santosh",
    "year": "1929 - 1997",
    "intro": "Born Gulam Rasool Dar in a Shia Muslim family in Srinagar in Kashmir on 20 June 1929, the artist took on his wife\u2019s Hindu name \u2018Santosh\u2019 as his own, in a move opposing patriarchy and religion.",
    "bio": "His father\u2019s death forced a young Gulam to work as a signboard painter, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 artist, and weaver. He learnt to paint watercolour landscapes from Dina Nath Raina in Kashmir before studying under N. S. Bendre at M. S. University, Baroda, on the recommendation of S. H. Raza. In Baroda, he produced a large body of figurative and landscape works, mainly in the cubist style.\nIn Kashmir, Santosh found inspiration in the Hindu and Buddhist tantric cults that had coexisted with the region\u2019s Sufi mysticism for centuries. At the Amarnath cave in Kashmir in 1964, Santosh had a deeply spiritual experience that turned him towards\u00a0the philosophy of tantra. Driven by the primordial\u00a0purusha-prakriti\u00a0concept of cosmic creation, he expressed the fusion of the sexual and the transcendental in his works and pioneered the neo-tantra school. An acclaimed writer and poet in Kashmiri and Urdu, Santosh wrote on tantric philosophy in English as well.\nSantosh was awarded the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award thrice, in 1957, 1964 and 1973, the Kala Ratna Award by All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, in 1991, and received the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 1977. He also won the Sahitya Akademi award for his collection of poems, Besukh Ruh, in 1979.  He passed away on 10 March 1997.",
