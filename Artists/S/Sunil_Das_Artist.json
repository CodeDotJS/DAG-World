    "name": "Sunil Das",
    "year": "1939 - 2015",
    "intro": "One of India\u2019s most important post-modernist painters, Sunil Das is known for his iconic drawings and paintings of horses and bulls.",
    "bio": "He rose to prominence early when he became the only Indian artist to win the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award while still an undergraduate student, in 1959.\nBorn on 4 August 1939 in Calcutta, he joined the city\u2019s Government College of Arts and Crafts in 1955. Later, on a French government scholarship, he went to study at \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he also trained with S. William Hayter and Krishna Reddy at Atelier 17.\nBetween 1950 and 1960, Das created thousands of drawings of horses. He spent hours at the stables of Calcutta\u2019s mounted police, studying horses and making sketches. While in Europe, Das visited Spain and after witnessing a series of bullfights, made several drawings and paintings of bulls. His flawless drawings capture the speed, power, and energy, of these equines and bovines, symbolic of the energy, aggression, and power, of modern times and of his own untamed youthful spirit and a sense of liberation.\nDas also created a series to represent the pressures women are subjected to, in an almost surreal manner. F. N. Souza once said about Das\u2019s work: \u2018His paintings are often about death and horror\u2026 [He is] a master of the horrific in art.\u2019 Experimenting with techniques, mediums, and styles, throughout his career, Das passed away in Kolkata on 10 August 2015.",
