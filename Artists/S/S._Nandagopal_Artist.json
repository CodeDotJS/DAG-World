    "name": "S. Nandagopal",
    "year": "1946 - 2017",
    "intro": "Born in Bangalore to the illustrious K. C. S. Paniker, the father of the Madras Art  Movement and the visionary behind Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village, S. Nandagopal\u2019s tryst with art, unsurprisingly, began early on. Just like his father, Nandagopal\u2019s work was a synthesis of tradition and modernity.",
    "bio": "The folk trope in his \u2018pictorial sculptures\u2019 was unmistakable. His workmanship, wherein the artist employed copper and brass with silver plating, adding enamelling judiciously for a touch of colour, allowed his artistic oeuvre to evolve further. The beating of the metal sheet and the exercise of cutting, welding, drilling, and hammering, was a meditative process for him.\nFollowing a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics in 1966 from the University of Madras, he secured a diploma in fine arts from the Government College of Fine Art, Madras, in 1971. In the same decade, he moved to Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village with his family.\nA recipient of several honours, Nandagopal was awarded the prestigious Lalit Kala Akademi award in the years 1970 and 1978. He was a gold medallist at the fourth International Triennale in New Delhi in 1978. In 2002, he received the Jindal Stainless Steel Award for Sculpture. He was also a recipient of the Homi Bhabha fellowship (1980), the British Council travel grant and the Indian Council for Cultural Relationships travel grant, both in the \u201980s, and the Government of India senior fellowship (1990).\nIn 2017, he succumbed to a cardiac arrest at the age of seventy-one at his residence in Cholamandal Artists' Village.",
