    "name": "Shanti Dave",
    "year": "b - 1931",
    "intro": "Shanti Dave was one of the earliest Indian artists to experiment with different media on canvas, beyond oil and acrylics. His experiments with encaustic, in combination with oil, have resulted in paintings in high relief.",
    "bio": "Born in a family of limited means, Shanti Dave grew up in a village called Badpura in north Gujarat. Moving later to Ahmedabad, he earned a living by painting signboards and billboards for films before enrolling at the Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, where he studied under eminent artist-teacher N. S. Bendre, completing his graduation (1950-56) and post diploma in Fine Art (1956-58).\nKnown for his paintings as well as large murals\u2014such as those that  adorned Air India\u2019s offices in London, New York, and Frankfurt\u2014his concerns were modernist, evident in the formal abstraction in his work, with a focus on the medium and its possibilities more than incorporating ideological narratives.\nLater, he consciously preferred printmaking, attracted as much to the medium\u2019s democratic nature for both the artist and the buyer, as also for the possibility of greater textures it offered.\nA co-founder of the Baroda Group in 1956 with fellow artists, Dave won the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi three years in a row, in 1956, \u201957 and \u201958. He was honoured with the Government of India\u2019s Padma Shri in 1985 and received the Sahitya Kala Parishad\u2019s award in 1986. The artist lives in New Delhi.",
