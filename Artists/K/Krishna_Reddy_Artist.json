    "year": "1925 - 2018",
    "intro": "Born in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh, on 15 July 1925, Krishna Reddy is best remembered for pioneering the simultaneous colour printing technique, or the colour viscosity process, along with S. W. Hayter, in Paris.",
    "bio": "Reddy's journey to that seminal moment in Paris was preceded by a stint at Santiniketan, studying under Nandalal Bose (1942-47), and then, as head of the art section at Kalakshetra, Madras (1947-50).\nReddy travelled to Europe with the support of philosopher J. Krishnamurthy, first studying at Slade School of Fine Art, London, and then training in sculpture with Henry Moore, Ossip Zadkine and Mario Marini. Interactions with Constantin Brancusi and Alberto Giacometti profoundly influenced his work.\nIn Paris, Belarusian-born French sculptor Zadkine introduced Reddy to S. W. Hayter, founder of the influential print studio, Atelier 17. It was here, in the early 1950s, that the most important developments in Reddy\u2019s career took place. Through his colour viscosity process, Reddy managed to attain a range of extraordinary colours on the plate, with each print becoming an individual coloured image. His abstract and semi-abstract prints revolved around the themes of nature and human figures. He also created sculptures in bronze, terracotta, stone, and marble.\nReddy became the first Indian to be appointed director of Atelier 17. Though not as feted in the country of his birth as internationally, Reddy was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1972. In 1976, he shifted to New York, where he passed away on 22 August 2018.",
