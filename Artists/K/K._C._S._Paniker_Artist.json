    "bio": "Born in Coimbatore on 31 May 1911,\u202fPaniker\u202fstudied in Kerala and, briefly, at Madras Christian College. He forsook studies for a job in the Post and Telegraph Department, where he worked for five years, and later as an insurance agent. But he had been painting watercolours as early as 1922, and had begun showing regularly from 1928 at the all India exhibitions of the Madras Fine Arts Society.\nAs a teenager, Paniker watched D. P. Roy Chowdhury painting by the pavement before the Government College of Art and Craft on Poonamallee High Road, Madras. At the age of twenty-five in 1936, Paniker gave up his job to join the college, graduating with a diploma in 1940.\nSoon after his graduation, he was appointed a painting instructor at his alma mater, where he would later become the principal in 1957, a position he would hold for the next decade till his retirement. Drawn to the academic style in his early career, he renounced it in favour of indigenous styles and contexts to revolutionise painting methodologies in the art college, also setting up an artists\u2019 commune that continues to thrive in Chennai. His investigation\u202finto\u202flocal calligraphy and metaphysical abstraction formed the basis of\u202fhis\u202fmature art,\u202fresulting\u202fin\u202fhis well-known\u202fseries,\u202fWords and Symbols.",
