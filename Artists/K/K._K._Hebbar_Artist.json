    "bio": "For Hebbar, Indian classical art remained a ceaseless source of inspiration, even though he was drawn to impressionism while studying at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, from 1934-38. His early paintings\u2014landscapes and figural compositions in the academic style\u2014disciplined his hand and mind and led him towards his own style.\nInspired by the Sri Lankan philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy\u2019s discourses, Hebbar began exploring his creativity through the traditional Indian art found in Jain manuscripts, Rajput and Mughal miniatures, and the Ajanta frescos, harmoniously blending it with surrealism and abstraction in his work. Strongly inspired by Amrita Sher-Gil\u2019s expression of the East through western techniques, Hebbar left for Europe in 1949 to explore western art further.\nThis exploration brought him to the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris where he studied under the impressionist painter Professor Cavailles, and later graphics at \u00c9cole Estienne. From 1964-75, he travelled across Europe, exhibiting his work. Upon his return, Hebbar experimented with mediums, methods and styles in order to find his own metre, even learning the classical dance form of Kathak to understand rhythm. Instinctively, he portrayed places and people as he saw them\u2014a developing India in which he witnessed both celebration as well as suffering.\nIn 1976, Hebbar was selected a fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi. From 1953-73, he served as the chairman of the Artist\u2019s Centre, Bombay, and received the Padma Bhushan from the Government of India in 1989. He passed away on 26 March 1996.",
