    "bio": "Born in\u00a0Shivpur\u202fDiyar in\u202fBallia district of Uttar Pradesh, Singh studied at College of Art,\u202fLucknow. In 1963,\u202fhe\u202freceived\u202fformal training in fresco-making from\u202fBanasthali\u202fVidyapith, Rajasthan. He especially enjoyed creating portraits in the small format which comprised a central plane bearing the figure surrounded by a thick border intricately and delicately detailed with patterns of birds, flowers, and trees. His Mutiny series of portraits is well-known, which commemorates the heroes of the revolt of 1857\u2014Rani Lakshmi Bai, Maratha leader Nana Saheb Peshwa II, his prime minister Azimullah Khan, and Rana Beni Madho Singh of Awadh, among others. The portrait of Rani Lakshmi Bai from this series was published in a calendar by The Hindustan Times alongside that of M. F. Husain\u2019s Mahisasurmardini.\nSingh even painted subjects not usually associated with traditional miniature paintings, such as an Indian woman chopping vegetables in the courtyard of a traditional house. He did stippling work and practised the wash and tempera technique.\nThe artist served as the head of the\u202fmodelling department, State Museum, Lucknow, from 1958-79, and was head\u202fof the observation division, National\u202fResearch Laboratory, Lucknow, from\u202f1979-94. His many awards include the Gandhi Centenary Exhibition award in 1970.",
