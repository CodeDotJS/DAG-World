    "year": "b - 1934",
    "intro": "Natvar Bhavsar is an abstractionist known for his colour-field paintings, working on large canvases with pigments made of natural and organic materials.",
    "bio": "Born in an educator\u2019s family on 7 April 1934 in a small town in Gujarat, he studied to be a drawing teacher and began his career in Chanasma. He then joined the C. N. School in Ahmedabad for its five-year diploma course in art offered by Sir J. J. School of Art; simultaneously, he continued to study for his master\u2019s in teaching art.\nAs a twenty-seven-year-old, Bhavsar learnt about the possibilities of further education from a class fellow\u2019s father and enrolled at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art to study industrial design, but once there, changed course to study painting at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University. Here, he met Janet Brosious, an artist and art educator; they would later marry in 1978. In 1970, he had his first show at Max Hutchinson Gallery, New York.\nHis paintings invariably have an Indian title, linking his works closely to the land of his birth and youth, and they often address subjects or myths familiar to those from India\u2014whether in a literal or abstract sense. \u2018Bhavsar is at once a thoroughly American painter and product of Indian culture,\u2019 Carter Ratcliff, art writer, said of him. Well established and widely appreciated, Bhavsar lives and works in New York.",
