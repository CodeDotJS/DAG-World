    "intro": "Ramgopal  Vijaivargiya is best known for paintings with Ajanta-like characteristics of gracefully curving bodies, soft smiling mouths, half-closed, doe-like eyes, sinuous arms, and long, tapering fingers.",
    "bio": "Born in Baler in Rajasthan\u2019s Sawai Madhopur district in 1905, he developed a keen interest in painting at an early age, initiated by a wandering sadhu of the Ram Snehi sect. He joined Maharaja School of Art and Craft in Jaipur, where Asit Kumar Haldar was principal.\nVijaivargiya later studied watercolour wash under Shailendra Nath Dey, a disciple of Abanindranath Tagore. Both Haldar and Dey were proponents of the Bengal School, which had a profound influence on Vijaivargiya\u2019s work. He drew inspiration from the plays of the classical Sanskrit playwright from the fourth-fifth century CE, Kalidasa, Hindu epics, the medieval poet Bihari\u2019s,\u00a0and\u00a0the Persian poetry of Omar Khayyam, Sadi, and Hafiz.\nPersonal discovery of traditional Rajasthani paintings led to the second genre of work that Vijaivargiya created\u2014vignettes of vividly-coloured Rajasthani life, linear studies of rustic simplicity of work and play, and the whirl of fairs and festivals. Gaining considerable recognition for his paintings by the time he was thirty, his paintings were frequently reproduced in Modern Review\u00a0and\u00a0Amrit Bazar Patrika, Bengali magazines Prabasi\u00a0and\u00a0Basumati, and several Gujarati and Hindi magazines. Vijaivargiya headed Rajasthan Kala Mandir and Rajasthan School of Art from 1945-66. In 1984, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.",
