    "intro": "Though Ram Kumar created figurative works in his early years, he came to be known for his unique style of abstraction, a genre that he turned to, while in Varanasi, where he had gone to paint with friend and fellow artist M. F. Husain.",
    "bio": "Born in Simla on 23 September 1924, Ram Kumar studied for his master\u2019s in economics at St. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi University. While at college, Kumar attended evening classes at Sarada Ukil School of Art, where he learnt the \u2018Western style\u2019 of painting under Sailoz Mookherjea.\nHis unpeopled, abstract landscapes are devoid of the usual constituents of reality, only suggesting land, trees, sky, and water, through the intensity of colours.\nLike several first-generation, post-colonial Indian artists, such as F. N. Souza, S. H. Raza, Akbar Padamsee, and Paritosh Sen, Ram Kumar combined a desire for global success with the need to belong emphatically to his homeland. In 1950, he left for Paris to study under Andr\u00e9 Lhote and Fernand L\u00e9ger, where he became part of the communist circle of intelligentsia, attending meetings and demonstrations. Upon his return to India, he regularly exhibited with Delhi Silpi Chakra, becoming by the mid-1950s one of India\u2019s emerging young painters. He received the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1956 and 1958, and the Government of India\u2019s Padma Shri in 1971. In addition to being a visual artist of repute, Kumar was also a prolific writer in Hindi.\nOne of India\u2019s foremost modernists, Kumar passed away on 14 April 2018.",
