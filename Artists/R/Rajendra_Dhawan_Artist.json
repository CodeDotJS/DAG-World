    "intro": "The colours melded together in Rajendra Dhawan's works, never in contrast, never opposed to each other, having, instead, a quiet conversation, one moving seamlessly into another.",
    "bio": "Born in 1936 in New Delhi, he studied at the Polytechnic (later renamed College of Art) from 1953-58, and at Belgrade in erstwhile Yugoslavia from 1960-62. While in New Delhi, he became a founding member of the group called The Unknown that survived from 1960-64.\nDhawan participated in many shows following his return from Belgrade and also taught art at a college in Phagwara, Punjab. However, he left for Paris in 1970 to study at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, eventually settling down in the French capital. Thereafter, he made infrequent visits to New Delhi for a few exhibitions. In Paris, the reclusive Dhawan was described by his peers as a \u2018painter\u2019s painter\u2019 and comparisons were made of his work with those of V. S. Gaitonde and J. Swaminathan.\nTwo other prominent Indian abstractionists were Dhawan\u2019s contemporaries in Paris \u2014 S. H. Raza and V. Viswanadhan\u2014but unlike them, Dhawan did not claim an indigenist abstraction, simply letting his art be for its own sake.\nThe metaphysical nature of Dhawan\u2019s work stayed constant throughout his career. Looking back at a lifetime of work, in 2011, a year before he passed away, Dhawan observed in an exhibition catalogue: \u2018My works have evolved as I have with time. I paint today as I did years ago, but when I sometimes look back, I see that change. It was a subtle, slow change.\u2019",
