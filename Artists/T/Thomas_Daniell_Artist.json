    "bio": "Thomas Daniell was born to an inn-keeper in Surrey, England, in 1749. He studied painting at the Royal Academy, London, after odd jobs of bricklaying and painting coaches. Although he exhibited 30 works at the academy between 1772 and 1784, Daniell found it difficult to establish himself as a landscape painter in Britain. Like many other Europeans at that time, he was drawn to India by stories of its wealth and possibilities of painting the exotica\u2014chiefly in the wake of the landscapist William Hodges\u2014and in 1784 obtained permission from the East India Company to travel to Calcutta as an engraver, accompanied by his nephew as his assistant.\nThe Daniells arrived in India in 1785 and over the next ten years, travelled extensively, sketching and painting sceneries, people and customs, architecture and ruins, flora and fauna. They travelled across the Himalayas, along the river Ganga, through the mountains and jungles of the south, as well as the Presidency cities of Calcutta and Madras.\nUpon their return to England,\u202fthe\u202fDaniells made several aquatints from the drawings they had amassed, brought together in\u202fa\u202fcollection\u202fof one hundred and forty prints\u202fissued\u202fin\u202fsix volumes from 1795 to 1808,\u202fcollectively called\u202fOriental Scenery, a publication that achieved great success.\u202fThey published aquatints on Calcutta too, titled Views of Calcutta.",
