Inspired by Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me of \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, he trained privately under L\u00e9on Bonnat. He soon emerged as the most important American artist of orientalism as he travelled extensively to paint visual chronicles of various Eastern cultures.\nIn 1882-83, Weeks travelled through India making several paintings of common people and royalty, becoming the first known American artist to come to India. Notable sketches and paintings done during this trip featured in his book, From the Black Sea through Persia and India. These included images of common scenes in British Indian cities such as Karachi (\u2018Kurrachee\u2019), Lahore, Amritsar, Benares, Mathura, and Agra.\nHe returned again to India in 1887, travelling extensively till 1893, choosing, this time, to go through the \u2018Rajpootana\u2019 and Malwa (present-day Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) to which he devoted multiple chapters in his book; with exhaustive details and prints of his paintings of various states of the \u2018Rajpootana\u2019. He not only visited but also made copious drawings and paintings on the life in the princely states of \u2018Bikanir\u2019, \u2018Jodhpore\u2019, \u2018Jussulmeer\u2019, \u2018Oudeypore\u2019, \u2018Jeypore\u2019 (Bikaner, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Udaipur and Jaipur respectively), Alwar and Gwalior, as also \u2018Cashmir\u2019 (Kashmir), Baroda and Hyderabad\u2014 the states he collectively referred to as \u2018India of the Rajahs\u2019.\nA highly awarded artist, he was decorated with the government\u2019s Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1896.
