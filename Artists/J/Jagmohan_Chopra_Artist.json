    "bio": "Chopra obtained a diploma in fine arts from Delhi Polytechnic in 1958. Soon after, he joined his alma mater (better known as College of Art), as a senior lecturer, where he set up the printmaking department along with colleague and eminent artist Somnath Hore. It was here that an enthusiastic group of printmakers coalesced around him, leading to the founding of Group 8 under his stewardship. He set up a makeshift print studio in his living room for the benefit of his students.\nHis own pursuit as an artist was influenced and encouraged by Hore. For his intaglio prints, Chopra dispensed\u202fwith\u202fthe\u00a0use of\u00a0acid on zinc plate, using cardboard plate instead, which, unlike zinc, was inexpensive and easily available to students. Chopra was also an active painter and photographer.\nHe headed several art institutions\u00a0such as\u00a0New Delhi\u2019s\u202fAll\u202fIndia Fine Arts and Crafts Society and Lalit Kala Akademi, Chandigarh. He served as principal of the Government College of Art, Chandigarh, from 1976-92. He exhibited widely and was member of the international jury at the second Biennale of Art in Havana, in 1986. \u00a0He passed away on 3 March 2013 in New Delhi.",
