    "bio": "Dey has been the\u202fco-founder of several\u202fartist\u202fcollectives\u202fsuch as Group 8, The Six, and Gallery 26. Like other Group 8 artists, he practiced printmaking at the workshop set up by pioneering printmaker Jagmohan Chopra in his living room for the benefit of his students. It was a space frequented by other printmakers such as Anupam Sud. In the early years of their career, these artists often used the inexpensive, cardboard-based collography technique instead of the more expensive etching process.\nDey\u2019s early paintings can be classified as transformed landscapes, almost surreal in execution. He later moved to figurative works, where too the subtext remained surrealist. A common trope in his works is the representation of women, solitary or in groups, in contemplative situations, often accompanied by a peacock.\nIn 1965, Dey joined the College of\u202fArt, New Delhi, as a lecturer, from where he retired in 2002.\u202f\u202fHe participated in several print exhibitions, such as the 1985 All India Prints Exhibition organised at the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, and the Inter Asia Graphics exhibition in Manila, the Philippines, in 1968. He participated in various printmaking workshops run by Paul Lingren and Krishna Reddy, a lithography camp at Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, and another at Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal, in 1995.\nThe New Delhi-based artist has won several awards in his career such as the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society award thrice,\u202fthe Kala Shree award in 1997, and the\u202fLalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 2000.",

    "intro": "Jaya Ganguly is known for turning the concept of aesthetics on its head while portraying social hypocrisies through her paintings.",
    "bio": "However, it\u2019s not just the duplicity of the privileged vis-\u00e0-vis the have-nots that she seeks to express, but also the pretenses that the former keep up with in their comfortable yet orthodox existence.\nBorn on 3 October 1958 in Calcutta, Ganguly graduated from\u00a0the\u00a0city\u2019s Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship\u202fin 1982. She fills her paintings with voluminous figures, rendered with broad brushstrokes in a spectrum of colours. Painted against monochromatic backgrounds, her figures of men and women from a thriving social milieu are often repulsive\u2014their distortions alluding to the burden of repression they carry on their shoulders yet are comfortable with due to years of internalisation.\nBy stripping them of an idealised veneer of beauty, Ganguly not only dissents against the conventional norms of portraying women in art but also makes them real and relatable. For instance, her mixed media work titled The Kiss is a take on the eponymous and famous work of Gustav Klimt, which was a shimmering ode to the first flush of passion. Though her work is often bracketed as feminist, it is more a chronicle of reality from a woman\u2019s point of view than an activist\u2019s focus on the condition of women.\nThe Kolkata-based artist has been the recipient of several awards\u2014from the Indian College of Arts and Draftsmanship, Kolkata, (1980), by Bhopal Biennale (1996), and the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata (1997).",

    "intro": "Born on 15 February 1939 in Faridpur (now in Bangladesh), Jogen Chowdhury\u2019s family moved to Calcutta following the Partition.",
    "bio": "Chowdhury studied art at the Government College of Art and Crafts, Calcutta, and subsequently at \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. A student of Prodosh Das Gupta, Chowdhury worked in the expressionist style of figuration in his early years. He created his own gallery of the grotesque, featuring lewd men with bellies like sacks and women with loose, hanging breasts. The Paris sojourn sharpened his creative thought process, helping in the evolution of his distinctive personal style.\nChowdhury interprets the human form through the x-ray vision of his creativity: attenuated, exaggerated, fragmented, reconfigured, and rephrased. For Chowdhury, the body has to communicate in silence. Often placing his figures against a vacant background, he does not appropriate the specificity of place or environment; instead, he transfers feelings of anguish on to his figures through gestural mark-making. His dense, crosshatched lines simulate body hair and a web of veins takes away the smooth sensuality of the classical body to manifest the textures of life.\nChowdhury believes art in India is neither subsumed in the miniature traditions nor in those of Ajanta, for India is neither a monolith nor a static entity; and that a notion of Indianness should not be fixed into some kind of timeless loop. He has been awarded the Madhya Pradesh government\u2019s Kalidas Samman, and was honoured at the 2nd Havana Biennale. He lives and works in Kolkata and Santiniketan.",

In search of a new visual language, Seal drew his inspiration from indigenous sources, depicting mostly Bengali women in rural setting, bearing the influence of his classmate Hemendranath Mazumdar.\nSeal\u2019s preferred medium was oil. Though following the canons of academic realism, Seal rendered some of his figures in the format of Indian miniature paintings.\nSeal\u2019s close association with like-minded artists such as Nirode Majumdar, Jamini Roy, B. C. Law, and Atul Bose\u2014all trained in the Western academic style\u2014 led, in 1919, to the establishment of the Indian Academy of Fine Arts in Calcutta. In 1921, Atul Bose and Seal founded the Society of Fine Arts. Seal\u2019s paintings were appreciated during his lifetime and were collected by Sir Rajendra Prasad Mukhopadhyay and the king of Burdwan.",

    "bio": "In the early 1960s, he went to the Accademia de Belle Arti in Naples, Italy, on a scholarship and then to the Pratt Institute in New York, where he was exposed to abstract expressionism. He was also a fellow of the John D. Rockefeller III Fund.\nA keen experimenter, Bhatt\u2019s early works reflected the influence of cubism, later shifting to pop-art imagery, to finally arrive at a style inspired by traditional folk designs. Though Bhatt worked in a variety of mediums including watercolours and oils, it was his printmaking that garnered him the most attention. In the late \u201960s, Bhatt began the photo documentation of traditional Indian craft and design, which was born out of an assignment for a seminar on Gujarati folk art but evolved into a lifelong passion. Bhatt considers his documentary photographs to be an art form. His simply composed photographs have become valued on their own merit.\nA founder member of the Baroda Group of Artists, he was also part of Group 1890. He received the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1963-64, a gold medal at the International Print Biennale in Florence, Italy, in 1967, the first prize for the design of a postal stamp for India\u2019s twenty-fifth anniversary of Independence in 1972, and the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 2019.

    "bio": "Ali also studied textile design at the Madras Government Textile Institute, and pursued a photography course in London. He not only learnt the strict discipline of classical art, but also engaged in an intense search for a modern Indian idiom for the arts, fuelled by the conviction that much of modern European art was formalistic and \u2018cold\u2019.\nIn search of his own style, he discovered the Indian tribal art with inspiration coming from the writings of renowned anthropologist Verrier Elwin. Struck by the freshness of tribal art whose canon was distinct from the established norms of classical art, Ali engaged with the tribal communities of Bastar in central India and began perfecting the new-found style.\nBesides, Ali drew inspiration from the Hindu mythology, studying deities in the complexity of popular worship and iconography, including techniques employed by folk artists to express these iconographies. His\u00a0Naga-Panchika\u00a0and\u00a0Ganesha\u00a0series are manifestations of that phase. A further search for new imagery led him to calligraphic symbols of words and sounds to convey their philosophical depth.\nAli joined the Progressive Painters\u2019 Association, Madras, in 1954, and taught art at the Rishi Valley School, Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh, in the early Fifties. He was honoured with the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1966 and 1978. He was also a founding member of the Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village on the outskirts of Madras.",

    "intro": "One of India\u2019s most loved artists, Jamini Roy is remembered for forging a unique Indian aesthetic for modern art by bringing together elements of traditional Bengali folk art and Kalighat patachitras, rendered in clean lines and earthy colours.",
    "bio": "Born on 11 April 1887 in a landowning family in Bankura district of Bengal, Roy trained in European academic-realist painting at the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, and began his career painting landscapes and portraits.\nSoon, moving away from these, he started experimenting with a more indigenous visual vocabulary. Level surfaces, flattening of design in depth, and the use of dissonant primary colours were aspects of folk painting that Roy incorporated in his work. Also, he took up the volumetric forms of the Kalighat patachitras. However, unlike the spontaneous brushwork of the traditional\u00a0patuas, Roy\u2019s lines were more restrained and precisely delineated.\nRoy would paint several versions of a subject, breaking and reforming the theme over months. Turning his family into a production unit, he tried to emulate a craft-guild mode of artistic production. He painted on a wide range of themes\u2014common people, mythological tales, Christian iconography, as well as visual characteristics of home-sewn Bengal quilts and Byzantine icons.\nRoy was awarded the Viceroy\u2019s gold medal in 1935, the Padma Bhushan in 1955, and elected a fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1956. Declared a National Treasure artist in 1976, his works cannot be exported. He passed away on 24 April 1972.",

Before Independence, he joined the Congress Socialist Party, and later the Communist Party of India. However, by the mid-1950s, he became disillusioned with politics and returned to painting.\nSwaminathan studied art briefly at Delhi Polytechnic and, later, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw on a scholarship. His earlier works showed an inclination towards the neo-tantric trends. In the late \u201960s, as Swaminathan began to probe the relation of colour to space and studied Pahari miniatures, he came up with the Colour Geometry of Space series which was followed by the Bird, Mountain, Tree and Reflection paintings. In 1962, he spearheaded the formation of Group 1890. He also brought out the journal, Contra \u201966, that called for reformation of Indian art.\nWhile working at Bharat Bhavan and its art museum, Roopankar, Swaminathan supported the rich tribal art of Madhya Pradesh. He helped bring tribal artist Jangarh Singh Shyam to national and international consciousness. Swaminathan served as director of Roopankar till 1990, returning to Delhi thereafter. He passed away on 25 April 1994.",

    "intro": "Jeram Patel, who earned renown as an abstractionist, was among those artists who rebelled against modernistic approaches and altered the Indian art scene of the 1960s by formulating a new visual identity and method of abstraction.",
    "bio": "Born in Sojitra, Gujarat, Patel studied drawing and painting at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay (1950-55), and typography and publicity design at Central School of Arts and Craft, London (1957-59). He was one of the twelve founder members of Group 1890 who, according to their manifesto, believed in \u2018the reality of the image rather than the image of reality\u2019. The group was short-lived but it\u2019s ideals persisted, evolving an individual vocabulary in the works of each of its members.\nPatel\u2019s syntax involved abstraction of the image and its manifestation in an evocative and potent language, of which the most well-known works are his black-and-white drawings and paintings in ink, and blowtorch and burnt wood works. A striking aspect of his blowtorch and burnt wood works was the sensuous use of colour in sharp contrast to the rough texture of the burnt area.\nDrawing remained of primary importance to Patel throughout his career and his works were widely exhibited in India and abroad, including the Sao Paolo Biennale in 1963 and 1977. He was a recipient of the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1957, 1963, 1973, and 1984, and the national award for design in 1976. He passed away in Vadodara on 18 January 2016.",

Throughout his life, he remained associated with children\u2019s projects at Bal Bhawan, an institute where he had taught briefly early on in his career.\nWhat remained constant was his lifelong quest to go beyond what could be explained and understood, and he gave expression to this pursuit of the mysterious through his vivid imagination. His works\u2014paintings, prints and sculptures\u2014are known for presenting a sense of duality, the visible and the invisible, the apparent and the elusive, the conscious and the subconscious.\nZharotia won several awards, including the Priyadarshini Award in 2004, senior fellow in the field of visual arts by the Government of India, 1998, Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1992, Sahitya Kala Parishad\u2019s award for silkscreen printing in 1979, among others.\nHis works have been collected by the National Gallery of Modern Art as well as the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi.

    "bio": "Sabavala studied at Elphinstone College, Bombay, before graduating from Sir J. J. School of Art in 1944. Thereafter, he studied at some of the leading art schools of Europe\u2014The Heatherly School of Art, London (1945-47), Acad\u00e9mie Andr\u00e9 Lhote, Paris (1948-51), Acad\u00e9mie Julian, Paris (1953-54), and Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re, Paris (1957).\nSabavala came to be known for his unique style that comprised a mix of academic, impressionistic, and cubist elements, almost always executed in his preferred muted oil colours. Beginning with portraits and still-lifes in the early years of his career, Sabavala started exploring different styles to soon arrive at his signature vocabulary. He introduced a sense or serenity and depth to his cubist landscapes through receding geometric planes. In the later years, his works incorporated his response to epochal current issues.\nSabavala\u2019s works are part of important collections such as the National Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide; Burmah Shell, London; Air India, Mumbai; and the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi. He received the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 1977, and All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society\u2019s Kala Ratna award in 2001. Arun Khopkar\u2019s film on his life, Colours of Absence, won a national award in 1994.\nSabavala passed away in Mumbai on 2 September 2011.",

Bomanji's subject matter was mostly ethnographic and remained limited to the Parsi community to which he belonged, depicting their life with easily available and willing models. He made a name for himself in oil portraiture.",
    "bio": "Born in Bombay, he joined Sir J. J. School of Art at the age of thirteen. While there, the principal, John Griffiths, identified his talent and appointed him a draughtsman on an expedition to the Ajanta caves in 1872, which he came to head in 1880. Though Bomanji initially wanted to be a sculptor, his interest in portraiture was triggered after 1877, when Griffiths recommended him as an apprentice to Valentine Prinsep, a visiting artist; he went on to train under John Lockwood Kipling.\nWith Griffith\u2019s encouragement, Bomanji exhibited at shows around the country, winning several important prizes such as the Governor\u2019s gold medal at Madras, Pune, and Calcutta, and a cash prize at the 1883 International Exhibition at Calcutta. Bomanji\u2019s works are often compared to that of Dutch artists for their unflattering realism, even once acknowledged as the \u2018Indian Rembrandt\u2019. His works are part of collections such as Prince of Wales Museum (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya) in Bombay, National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, the Tata Family Collection, and Indian Museum in South Kensington. He went on to be the first Indian vice-principal of Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay.",

Baptista, formed Contemporary Painters of Bombay, a collective much before the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group. He worked as a freelance artist in Bombay, working in the film industry as an art director, at printing presses and commercial studios. Setting up a furnishing industry at Hyderabad from 1947-67, he returned to being a fulltime artist in the 1950s.\nA sensitive artist, Reddy evolved a unique vision of his own, creating complex compositions, realistic and expressionistic portraits, still-lifes, and impressionistic landscapes. His later works are abstract, often revealing a tantric influence with folk motifs and symbols, and a synthesis of almost contrary forms. He was also trained in mural design and was acquainted with the Rajput and Pahari miniature styles.\nReddy received gold, silver and bronze medals from various art societies, including the Dolly Cursetjee award and Mayo scholarship for murals. He received numerous other awards from other institutions including the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, and the Andhra Pradesh Lalit Kala Akademi.

Subramanyan and Jyoti Bhatt at Baroda, provided Deb the impetus to explore set techniques and approaches to art.\nHe experiments with an endless repertoire of discarded material, shifting and recycling them into a new pictorial language. Thus, he translates his ideas into multiple hybrid forms through a unique metamorphosis of painting and sculpture. All his work comes imbued with quirky humour and a sense of drama, perhaps in a nod to his childhood desire to be a cartoonist.\nA respected mentor, Deb started teaching at Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta, in 1972, from where he retired as dean of the Faculty of Visual Arts in 2005. His research on Nandalal Bose and on education resulted in a series of articles published from 1984-99 in his department\u2019s journal. He also published a folio of serigraphs with Khoj, New Delhi, in 2006. The artist lives and works in Kolkata.",

    "bio": "Born and brought up in Jamshedpur in present-day Jharkhand, where career prospects appeared limited to engineering or medicine, his parents had hoped he would study architecture, but destiny had other plans as a friend took Singh to a local art class, which spurred his interest in drawing and painting.\nHe moved to New Delhi to study at College of Art. Upon graduation, he worked for an advertising agency for two years and returned to his alma mater as a lecturer, which allowed him to devote time to his passion. He benefitted greatly from discussions with the charismatic printmaker and colleague, Jagmohan Chopra, who turned his interest towards silkscreen printing. The medium appealed to Singh as it wasn\u2019t being practiced by many artists at that time, and it allowed him the scope to experiment. He also explored different genres of printing such as woodcuts, linocuts, and etchings.\nHis prints evoke an organic harmony between various elements of nature, in a pleasant juxtaposition of colours.  He practiced silkscreen printing for thirty years before shifting to painting in acrylic and oil in the year 2000. He received\u00a0the\u00a0Lalit Kala\u202fAkademi\u2019s\u202fnational award in the 1970s\u00a0and won the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society\u2019s Kala Vibhushan award for his contribution to art in 1988.

    "bio": "Uninfluenced by the European modern art trends till the 1940s, Sen experimented with a vocabulary drawn from Indian idioms. Exposure to the works of Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Paul Gaugin, and other masters, through their reproductions during his teaching years at Art College, Indore, sparked off Sen\u2019s interest in form. In 1942, he participated in the only exhibition of the Calcutta Group, of which he was a founder member.\nHowever, it was Sen\u2019s visit to Paris in 1949 that saw him formally acquainted with European art; he also met Pablo Picasso on this trip. Sen returned to India in 1954 and subsequently made paintings with themes from everyday life. His spontaneous response to the traumatic socio-political changes in West Bengal in the 1970s resulted in a series, where, along with large canvases, he installed a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture conveying a poster-like simplification of pop art, inspired by his travels in Mexico and Egypt.\nSen wrote on art for leading English and Bengali journals. In 1986, he wrote and illustrated a story in English, published by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. The French government conferred on him the\u00a0L\u2019officier de l\u2019ordre des arts et des lettres\u00a0and the Lalit Kala Akademi honoured him with the title of Lalit Kala Ratna in 2004.

He famously experimented with instant sculpture, done in a few minutes.\nHe was a founding member of Calcutta Group of artists in 1943\u2014one of the earliest groupings of modern Indian artists. As curator of the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, from 1957-70, he acquired works for the institution by seminal contemporaries such as M. F. Husain, Tyeb Mehta, F. N.

About a decade later, he went to Norway to study printmaking at Atelier Nord.\nSuperbly rendered hues and masterly brushstrokes lend a unique luminosity to his dense and mystic landscapes, which range from purely realistic to abstract, evolving in three different phases.\nThe first phase was his art school period, when he began painting landscapes, with an active interest in portraiture and figuration. In the second phase, he painted still-lifes and landscapes, and the third comprised mainly landscapes that show experimentation with techniques. Singh\u2019s mature works feature an orchestration of colour and light in rugged hills, boulders, trees and sky. Over the past decade, he also created a body of charcoal crayon on paper landscapes, quite like the bleached versions of his signature coloured works.\nSingh held his first solo show at Triveni Kala Sangam in 1967, and has exhibited extensively since then. He received the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1970. Singh lives and works in New Delhi with his artist wife, Arpita Singh, one of the doyennes of modern Indian art.",

Initially, he freelanced as an illustrator, also working as a designer at Bombay Dyeing.\nKolte\u2019s early works bore a strong influence of Paul Klee and his lyrical line. Like Klee, Kolte too found his inspiration in nature\u2014he attempted to paint like nature, relying on his intuition as opposed to imitating nature or drawing from it.\nPainting is highly meditative for Kolte, and he draws inspiration from the commentary on the Bhagvad Gita by the thirteenth century Marathi saint Dnyaneshwar. He eliminates anything representational on his canvases that are instead made up of layers of dripping paint. His work is often dominated by a single hue, like a symphony in colour that hides and reveals layers, and in which architectural or landscape-related forms are sometimes discernible. He experimented with installation and performance art in the early 1980s.\nKolte taught at his alma mater from 1974-94 before quitting to pursue painting fulltime. His first group show was at the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, in 1972, to mark the silver jubilee of India\u2019s Independence. Kolte lives and works in Mumbai.",

    "bio": "He learnt painting at his father, artist-teacher Prahlad Karmakar\u2019s atelier, till the socio-political turmoil of the 1940s and his father\u2019s early death put an end to it.\nAfter his matriculation, Karmakar joined Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, but quit soon thereafter for reasons of poverty. In between, he designed book covers and worked as an illustrator for his livelihood; he even joined the army but absconded after two years, driven by his desire to paint.\nKarmakar learnt the techniques of transparent and opaque watercolours from Kamalaranjan Thakur, a former student of his father, and Dilip Das Gupta. However, it was senior artist Nirode Majumdar\u2014once a student of Abanindranath Tagore\u2014who acquainted Karmakar with artistic and philosophical concepts, techniques, coherence of lines, and the breaking of form. Majumdar had recently returned from France after a stay of twelve years, and shared his rich experience with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nKarmakar held his first exhibition in 1959 on the railings of Indian Museum, Calcutta. In 1969-70, Karmakar visited France on a fellowship to study art museums, an inspiring exposure for the expressionist artist who, being \u2018primarily a colourist\u2019, began to create his figurative monochrome paintings in the 1970s. He won the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1968, and his work is part of important collections globally.\nHe passed away on 24 February 2014.",

    "bio": "A sculptor and painter, Sagara was born in Ahmedabad on 2 February 1931, in a family of traditional wood carvers. He fused modern perception of abstraction with his ancestral knowledge of the material. With a natural flair for drawing, he completed a master\u2019s in drawing in 1957 and a master\u2019s in arts in 1960 from Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay.\nSagara brought together watercolour, pastel, relief work, ornamental scraps, glass bead fragments, and metal, on his burnt wood sculptures, creating narratives that drew from his cultural heritage. For Sagara, the materiality of the work was as seminal as the narrative that the sum of the parts constructed. Inspired by folk culture, he explored the relationship of man with his environment, and the chaos and contradictions of life.\nSagara taught art at School of Architecture, C.E.P.T. University, Ahmedabad, from 1963 until his retirement. He participated in the Sao Paulo Biennale of 1971, Asian art show at Fukuoka Museum of Art, Tokyo, in 1979-80, and the 12th International Festival of Painters at Cagnes-sur-Mer in France, among other international shows. He received Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1963. He passed away on 23 January 2014 in Ahmedabad.",

    "bio": "Born on 25 April 1908, he joined Brahmacharya Ashram at the age of thirteen, under Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s tutelage. He took to art at a young age, copying the paintings of the great masters. After initial training in art under a European teacher, Roy joined the Tagore residence at Jorasanko in the 1920s. Groomed by Gaganendranath and Abanindranath Tagore, he worked on stage design and illustrated student magazines.\nRoy\u2019s initial inspiration was the Bengal School style of which he went on to become an exponent, known for his layers of delicate washes which he merged with a later, cubist language. Working with the wash technique, Roy brought architectural details into his painting in the manner of Indian miniature paintings. Using Chinese ink, he could create intense proliferation of tonal degrees and gradations. He applied warm pigments and expanded them with cool tonalities, thus creating a vibrant pictorial space. Also interested in carpentry and photography, Roy became curator of Kala Bhavana Museum, Santiniketan, in 1952.\nHis first solo show was held in New Delhi in 1951-52, followed by shows in Bombay, Gwalior, Lucknow, and several in Calcutta. He exhibited for the last time in Calcutta in 1971 and passed away on 19 December 1973.",

    "bio": "On completion of his training in drawing and painting at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, Khemraj, a fine violinist, left for New Delhi to learn the sitar from Pandit Ravi Shankar.\nIn his early years, Khemraj was influenced by senior artists S. B. Palsikar and A. A. Almelkar. A three-year government scholarship for studies in France, from 1962 to 1965, exposed the young artist to new styles and techniques. He studied with Atelier 17\u2019s Stanley William Hayter, the father of modern printmaking, Krishna Reddy, a pioneer in the field of simultaneous multi-coloured prints, and other cubist, impressionist, expressionist and surrealist artists, learning to express formations using line as a life-force.\nUpon his return from Paris, Khemraj began evolving an abstract signature style that he tried in acrylic or mixed media on mount board. His affinity to medieval and modern Western art movements and love for his own roots were inspirational in creating a fine balance between the two worlds. His series Hatheli, Charpai, Prithvi, Heart, and the powerful drawings called Singing Lines, were born from real-life encounters and the artist\u2019s spontaneous zest for life. His rendition of birds and flowers indicated Khemraj\u2019s conviction that life was a gift to revel in. In his last phase, his artistic expressions were those of an ancient philosopher and seer.",

It reflected in his phallic forms of the 1970s, isolated heads of the \u201980s, and the still pendulum clocks and abandoned staircases of the \u201990s.",
    "bio": "The grandnephew of the well-known sculptor V. P. Karmakar, and the son of an artist who worked in Bombay film studios, he was born on 16 March 1936 in Nagaon, Maharashtra. He joined Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, in 1954. He was inspired by the style of the Bauhaus painter Paul Klee, which reflected in his early watercolours and slightly later works with floating motifs on a transparent surface.\nThe tantric-oriented abstract format of his paintings was already set during his years at the Weavers\u2019 Service Centre in Varanasi, which he had joined in 1961. At Varanasi, along with other leading painters like K. G. Subramanyan, Gautam Waghela, and Ambadas, Barwe worked closely with weavers on the development of modern Indian textile designs.\nEqually at ease with the written word, Barwe published, in 1990,\u00a0a collection of well-delineated writings on the creative process, titled Kora Canvas. He received the Academy of Fine Arts award, Calcutta, in 1963, the Bombay Art Society\u2019s awards in 1964 and 1968, the Maharashtra state award and Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1976, the latter for his work, Blue Cloud.

    "year": "b - 1939",
    "intro": "Akkitham Narayanan, whose art philosophy was shaped by noted painter K. C. S. Paniker, was born in Kerala to a family involved in conducting Vedic rituals.",
    "bio": "Narayanan obtained a diploma in painting from the Government College of Art and Craft, Madras, in 1961, where he studied under Panicker. He next went to Paris on a government scholarship where he studied monumental painting under Jean Bertholle, and engraving under Lucien Couteau at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, from 1967-70. This exposure helped him arrive at a personal style which was a fusion of Indian tantric abstraction with Western geometric sensibility.\nWorking across mediums, Narayanan has experimented with colours and formal rhythms. Collapsing figures into minimal forms, he creates a field of geometric patterns, using triangles, squares, rectangles and circles as allusions to elements in nature\u2014fire, water, earth and ether. He has chosen the abstraction of geometrical constructions over formless abstraction, which is reminiscent of Vedic or tantric ritual elements, especially rhythmic chanting; his constructs have also evolved a unique relationship with colours.\nThe Paris-based artist\u2019s works have been exhibited widely in India and internationally. He has won many awards through the decades, the chief of which are from the Lalit Kala Akademi, Madras, in the 1960s; an award from the All India Print Exhibition, New Delhi, in 1972; another from the fourth International Festival of Painting at Cagnes-sur-Mer, France, the same year; and the K. C. S. Panicker Puraskaram from the Kerala Lalit Kala Akademi in 2009.",

Following encouragement from her Hungarian uncle, Ervin Baktay, Sher-Gil travelled to Europe to continue her education.\nIn France, she was enrolled at \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts where she studied the academic style of painting, becoming the youngest artist and the only Asian to be awarded a gold medal; she was also elected an associate member of the Grand Salon. Outside of the rigours of an academic schooling, the time spent among the French Bohemians played an important role in developing her artistic personality.\nIn her struggle to carve a unique artistic identity, Sher-Gil decided to move back to India. She travelled the country, visiting Bombay and further south, including the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, in a bid to explore the rich diversity of Indian culture. She strove to interpret the life of Indians, particularly the poor, through her own visual vocabulary which led her to paint various iconic canvases in her short artistic career.\nDespite her untimely death on 5 December 1941, she became the first woman artist to be recognised from India for her extraordinary boldness and felicity as a painter.

    "intro": "Belonging to the first generation of postcolonial Indian artists that sought cosmopolitan freedom in Paris and London during the 1950s and \u201960s, Akbar Padamsee developed his images within the genres of portraiture and landscape as refracted through the prism of high modernism.",
    "bio": "Born on 12 April 1928, Padamsee graduated from Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, in 1951. Shortly thereafter, he travelled to France, where he was awarded a prize by Andr\u00e9 Breton, French writer and poet, who is known as the co-founder of surrealism.\nPadamsee\u2019s career witnessed various phases with changing emphases. His early portraits and landscapes demonstrated a quasi-spiritual style of working. He subsequently abolished their very core whence they came to be termed as \u2018inscapes\u2019 in art-historical vocabulary. This proved to be one of the turning points in Padamsee\u2019s career, plunging him into much deeper subconscious layers. In addition to the already existing formal and aesthetic elements in his paintings, a new psychoanalytical dimension was added.\nHis pioneering spirit allowed him to experiment with a wide range of mediums\u2014from the traditional to the latest such as computer graphics. Whatever his chosen medium, he had a distinctive command over the use of space, form and colour. Padamsee\u2019s oils were characterised by a deep intensity and luminescence while his drawings exuded a serene grace.\nIn a career spanning six decades, Padamsee exhibited his works across the world. In 2010, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India. He passed away on 6 January 2020.",

In 2000, she received the Padma Shri from the Government of India. She lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "intro": "Born in Calcutta on 30 June 1959, Ananda Moy Banerji completed his B.F.A. in painting from the College of Art, New Delhi, in 1980, where he also studied printmaking under acclaimed printmaker Anupam Sud.",
    "bio": "He followed it up with an M.F.A. in printmaking from Kala Bhavana at the Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, in 1985. The same year, he joined the Polytechnic for Women, New Delhi, as a lecturer, while continuing to practice printmaking at the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s Garhi Studios. \nIn the 1970s and \u201980s, Banerji\u2019s works comprised landscapes, inspired, among other factors, by his stay in Santiniketan. However, the Naxal movement that took birth in the late 1960s in West Bengal awakened his artistic concerns towards wider social issues. Shifting back to New Delhi, his art became his response to the urban chaos of life coupled with jostling for power among humans.\nSoon, his quest for understanding human existence attained a spiritual perspective that distilled through his series titled Purusha and Prakriti. Recently, his works have become introspective, drawing from his own life, and from universal human feelings. \nBanerji has collaborated with renowned printmakers like Carol Summers, Krishna Reddy, and Paul\u00a0Lingren, and\u00a0has been the recipient of many awards, including the\u00a0Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1994. In 1996-97, Banerji was given the Charles Wallace India Trust Award in fine arts to work at London\u2019s Camberwell College of Arts.

    "name": "Arpita Singh",
    "year": "b - 1937",
    "intro": "An influential artist who is known for her richly detailed oils and watercolours, Arpita Singh was born in Calcutta in 1937.",
    "bio": "She studied art at Delhi Polytechnic (now College of Art) from 1954-59, and then joined the Government of India\u2019s cottage industries restoration programme in 1959, which allowed her to meet weavers and artisans.\nHer work in the 1970s would reflect this in the form of expressive black and white abstracts. By the \u201980s, she was seeking influence for her watercolours from Bengali folk paintings with women going about their daily tasks as her subject. In the \u201990s, she shifted dramatically to oil on canvas. Her work became more detailed, though the central figure remained the woman and her domestic preoccupations; women continue to play a major role in the transmission of memories in Singh's works. \nSingh treats the pictorial space like a postcard and fills it up with images in a throwback to her childhood.

He learned clay modelling from traditional artists Jadunath Pal and Bakkeshwar Pal, and sculpture from Leonard Jennings. \nA major artist of the revivalist Bengal School, Haldar experimented with different styles before evolving his own, and painted several series such as the History of India, Life of the Buddha and Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Linking metaphors and allegories, he raised illustrative art in India to a level of languid beauty never before achieved. Haldar\u2019s washes stood out for an attenuated delicacy and unusually large sizes. One of the several artists to copy the Ajanta cave paintings under Lady C. J. Herringham, Haldar also worked on copying the Jogimara and Bagh cave paintings in present day Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh respectively.\nHaldar taught at the Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, from 1911-23, becoming the first principal of the university\u2019s fine arts faculty, the Kala Bhavana, and, later, principal of the College of Arts and Crafts, Lucknow. During his stay in Santiniketan, he designed sets and acted in plays by Rabindranath Tagore. In 1934, Haldar was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, London, and conferred the title of Rai Sahib by the colonial British government.

After a few years he moved to Poona for better opportunities, where he began work at the Chitrashala Press, which brought him acclaim and patronage. Unsatisfied with the range of activities Poona too could offer, Mali shifted to Bombay with his family.\nMali was a contemporary of academic artist M. V. Dhurandhar and Raja Ravi Varma, the painter of mythological oils. At a time when Ravi Varma\u2019s works based on mythology and epics were a rage, Mali established contact with the artist, the association influencing his own art making. In south Bombay, Mali opened his own art space in time, Gurudas Studio. Moving in Bombay\u2019s wider intellectual and artistic circles, he met established authors whose novels he illustrated, besides other well-known publications. He also did illustrations for the famous writer of mythology and epics, Kanhayalal M. Munshi. \nHis well-known painting depicting the \u2018Jatayu Vadha\u2019 episode from the Ramayana was included in textbooks in Maharashtra; and a painting of Shri Khandoba of Jejuri, Poona, too became popular.

    "intro": "Born in Bengal, Arup Das remains one of the most formidable muralists and painters of Indian modern art.",
    "bio": "Das graduated from the Government College of Arts and Crafts Calcutta, in the 1940s. Later, in the 1960s, he became a member of All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi.\nIt was a British Council fellowship in 1972 that took Das to Europe, allowing him to gain exposure as an artist to the art movements and the work done by European masters. Many of his paintings, in fact, have the recurring theme of the messiah offering salvation and hope to people.\nLike many of his contemporaries, Das was affected by the socio-political landscape of the nation in the 1940s and the subsequent changes in the \u201950s. The struggles of people became a reason for the human figure occupying a central position in his paintings. In Das\u2019s art, man becomes a social and historical being, placed at the centre of the cultural environment. This makes Das\u2019s art timeless, created from the perspective of the socio-cultural moorings that he indexes remarkably in his art.\nThe artist had several shows in India and abroad. He won the national award from the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1957 and the President\u2019s silver plaque in 1957. His works are in the collections of the National Gallery of Modern Art, Sahitya Kala Parishad, and All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, among others.",

Largely self-taught, he is probably the first Indian artist to have articulated Indian subject matters through naturalism and the use of oil paints with brilliant mastery, considered until then a European idiom.",
    "bio": "Varma\u2019s forte was oil portraits of royalty, the sensuous depiction of women engaged in everyday activity, and vignettes from mythology and religious epics. His renditions of Hindu iconography and female mythological characters such as Sita, Shakuntala, Damayanti and Draupadi soon became extremely popular through their oleographs and calendars available in the market. So popular was Varma\u2019s art that it soon drew followers among several Indian artists, a number of them anonymous but painting in a style so strongly influenced by Varma\u2019s painting, that their art came to be known by the generic term Ravi Varma School.\nAmong the recognised Indian artists to paint in his mould were Hemendranath Majumdar (1894-1948), whose large oils of partially clothed or nude women with their air of voyeuristic eroticism attracted royal patronage, and Satish Chandra (1893-1965), whose gracefully modelled bodies feature in works with classical and romantic themes.",

    "bio": "In the Seventies, Amitava won the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award. In 1989, he won a fellowship to study exhibition and graphic design in Germany.\nIn his youth, Amitava was strongly influenced by the existential philosophy of Sartre and Camus as well as the poetry of Jibananda Das and Shakti Chattopadhyay. The existential dilemma of a man thrown into a world as a stranger is characteristic of his work. In his paintings, Amitava introduces a single figure within a dense, turgidly rendered space.\nHis affiliation is primarily to expressionism, even as his art appears to spring from an enigmatic subjectivity. In contrast to the fine linear quality of his drawings in which figures are built up through an accumulation of staccato lines, his paintings are realised through strong paint application and an unambiguous role of colour.\nIn Amitava\u2019s art, there is a collapse of the traditional aesthetics of beauty and equilibrium. He does not pass moral judgements on whether the figure is a victim, or perpetrator, or even an unexplained presence in a wasteland. Recently, though, his style has become even more abstract. Amitava experiments with medium and materials, sometimes even creating new ones. The medium used by the artist for conveying similar ideas becomes central to the content of the works. He lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "bio": "His contribution to furthering modernism in India assumes importance for being a seminal, individual effort. Born in present-day Bangladesh, Chakladhar graduated from the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, in 1960. In his long career as an artist, nature has dominated his art\u2014flowing water, swaying breeze, the softness of grass and petals, all captured beautifully by the artist with his brilliant mastery over form and technique.\nHis small, descriptive works reveal minute details, demonstrating the attention of his controlled brushwork. To give an example of his observation rendered delicately on paper, his Untitled watercolour depicting a Baul performance in a village haat (market) in Birbhum in Bengal can be quoted, which leaves one marvelling at the minutest of details he captures. He has worked across mediums and techniques, choosing to paint his acute observations of nature and life around him over subjects from Indian classics and mythology.\nChakladhar\u00a0has\u00a0participated in important exhibitions such as the centenary celebration of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1957, and the 1992 Hyderabad exhibition,\u202f'Bengal Art Today'.\u202fHe taught at his alma mater for several years, and has won many awards, including the prestigious.

Sometimes choosing the grid and at other times the curtain, Altaf created multiple pockets of space within his picture plane. He layered the passage of time with ambiguities regarding the purpose of life amidst haunting shadows and floating heads. He used colour effectively to invoke the dark psychic recesses vis-\u00e0-vis the illuminated passages in which the artist\u2019s self-portrait slowly dematerialised in its journey towards the spirit.\nMarried to fellow artist Navjot, Altaf represented a period in Indian art when artists wished to speak of the struggles of the common man and engage with him, taking art away from elitist connotations associated with the individual artist.\nIn 1971, Altaf participated in the Films Division\u2019s documentary The Young Canvas.

    "bio": "In 1957, Sehgal created a mural for Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, on a government commission, which was pulled down without his permission or any intimation in 1979. Sehgal went to court and won the lawsuit.\nBorn on 5 February 1922, in Campbellpur (now known as Attock, in Pakistan), Sehgal was educated in Lahore. Though interested in the arts, he obtained a degree in industrial chemistry and physics. Eventually, he went to study art at the New York University in 1948.\nSehgal returned to India after three years and worked as an arts consultant with the government for reviving folk arts. He quit the job in 1966 and moved to Europe, travelling and working as a practising artist. He participated in several exhibitions across Europe, eventually opening a studio in Luxembourg in 1979. Thereafter, he divided his time between India and Luxembourg.\nA versatile artist, Sehgal worked across mediums\u2014paintings, tapestries, graphic arts, even writing poetry\u2014but earned renown as a sculptor. Early exposure to trends in Western art through his travels informed his oeuvre as much as his heritage, chiselled through long years of work with folk artists. Awarded the prestigious Lalit Kala Akademi fellowship in 1993, he passed away in 2007 and was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 2008.",

    "intro": "Achutan Ramachandran Nair, popularly known as A. Ramachandran, was born in 1935 in Attingal, Kerala.",
    "bio": "He studied Malayalam literature before pursuing art at Kala Bhavana, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. Under the tutelage of Nandalal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij, he developed both the muralist\u2019s monumentality of scale and the intimate ambit of the miniaturist.\nRamachandran devoted the first half of his career to the exploration of the modern man in his urban environment, before reversing that trajectory to a celebration of life in rural India\u2014focussed on a community of Bhil tribals living near Udaipur, Rajasthan. As a result of this, his works encompass a mammoth range\u2014from the depiction of Kerala\u2019s socio-political situation through dark and tortured images in the early years, to classical art replete with decorative elements, motifs and exuberant colour, followed by an altogether seductive form, featuring women, birds, and beasts, in later years.\nRamachandran has also been an art teacher, and was associated with children\u2019s literature, writing and illustrating fifty picture books between 1961 and \u201992 that were published in India and abroad, most prominently in Japan.

    "name": "Avinash Chandra",
    "year": "1931 - 1991",
    "intro": "Born in Simla on 28 August 1931, Avinash Chandra studied painting at Delhi Polytechnic, where he also taught for a few years; his students included Paramjit Singh and Arpita Singh, who would go on to make a name for themselves in later years.\r\n.",
    "bio": "Despite two successful shows in India, Chandra was dissatisfied with the art scene in the country, and in 1956 moved to the United Kingdom, following his artist wife, Prem Lata, who was studying there on a scholarship. Before settling in London, he travelled widely through the U.S. and Europe, studying the language and technique of Vincent van Gogh and Cha\u00efme Soutine, and drawing inspiration from European city landscapes.\nThroughout his career, Chandra\u2019s recurrent theme remained the female body. He began with elegant line drawings which evolved through the 1970s into implicit, erotic, coloured drawings. Sexual imagery may have played a vital role in his art but was introduced as part of a much larger experience in a wider context. Employing the primitivist trope, Chandra often reduced female anatomy to shapes as though suspended in a space invaded by phallocentric forms.\nChandra was the first Indian artist to exhibit at one of the most important art events worldwide\u2014Documenta in Kassel, West Germany, in 1964. Widely collected, especially by museums in the U.K., Chandra won fellowships in the 1960s from the John D. Rockefeller III Fund and the Fairfield Foundation. He passed away in London on 15 September 1991.",

In 1999, he was awarded the Charles Wallace scholarship by the British Council, which took him to Wimbledon School of Art, London.\nThe artist works in various mediums, propelling him to understand the meditative quality and the language of each medium.

    "bio": "He trained at the Government College of Art in Calcutta from 1926-30, and at the Government School of Arts and Crafts, Madras, till 1932. He was an active member of various artist collectives such as the Calcutta Group that he joined in 1950, the Art Rebel Centre, and the Young Artists Union, of which he was a founder member.\nA prolific yet reclusive artist, Ash worked in a variety of mediums, including watercolour, tempera, acrylic, and oil; he was also a fine draughtsman. Starting out with landscapes and portraits, Ash evolved as an artist by experimenting with naturalistic and socio-realistic themes, and abstract expressionism. Common people toiling hard to earn their livelihood were frequent subjects in Ash\u2019s earlier works. One of his most acclaimed series was on the ravages of the 1943 Bengal famine that killed millions of people; a documentary film on the artist and his famine series was commissioned by the Government of India in 1985.\nBeginning with the first prize of the Madras Fine Arts Society in 1936, Ash received several awards in his lifetime, including the West Bengal government\u2019s Abanindra\u00a0Puraskar\u00a0in 1984. Filmmaker Nabyendu Chatterjee made a documentary on his life in the year he passed away.",

Keyt\u2019s attraction to the European style\u2014first Cezanne, and later cubism, especially Picasso\u2019s crisp lines and structural rendering of forms\u2014added an impetus to his Puranic and Buddhist narratives, and Indian erotic iconography, which he often depicted in his art.\nA member of \u201943 Group, a modern art collective formed in Colombo by a group of young, pro-independence painters who were committed to promoting a Sri Lankan form of modernism, Keyt\u2019s commitment to free expression gave his art its greatest merit: courage. Art critic Rudy von Leyden, reviewing Keyt\u2019s works in the 1940s, noted: \u2018If he speaks the language of Picasso, he does so in a rich and meaningful idiom of his own.\u2019 Because of his interest in Hindu mythology and multiple visits to India, his work is as well regarded here as in his native Sri Lanka.",

    "intro": "Born in 1937 in Calcutta, Ganesh Pyne lost his father before his teens and personally witnessed the horrors of Partition.",
    "bio": "The social violence and despair of the 1940s and the tumultuous political events of the 1970s had a deep impact on his psyche and work. Coupled with the influence of his grandmother\u2019s stories, Pyne developed an individual style of poetic surrealism woven around mythology and Bengali folklore.\nExploring the deep recesses of his imagination, Pyne created uncanny images of disquieting creatures that inhabited a world beyond the familiar. The distortion and exaggeration of facial features that he achieved in his works owed to his training as a draughtsman and animator at Mandar Studios in Calcutta, run by filmmaker Mandar Mullick, who invited Disney animators such as Claire Weeks to train artists.\nAn admirer of Abanindranath Tagore in his early years, Pyne successfully achieved a translucent effect in his tempera paintings. His great skill lay in dramatic rendering of light and shade\u2014the effect of a trapped, eerie light in small, dense works created an air of mystery.\nIn the 1970s, during one of his most productive phases, M. F. Husain described him as the best painter of the country to a news magazine. Pyne received the Gagan-Abani Puraskar of the Visva-Bharati University in 1997, a D.Litt. from Kalyani University, and the Kalyani and Abanindra Purashkar from the West Bengal Government in 2004. He passed away in Kolkata on 12 March 2013.",

    "bio": "She concerned herself with the human, particularly the female, condition in her paintings. She rejected the nomenclature of a \u2018feminist artist\u2019 as her creative concerns embraced local, regional and universal consciousness while addressing contemporary issues. They emerged from her understanding of engagements that overlap between history and memory.\nPal often used the\u00a0\u2018Kamadhenu\u2019\u00a0or wish-fulfilling cow as a metaphor for womankind\u2014both for her giving nature, as well as her anguish against exploitation. Her\u00a0'Nayika'\u00a0series expanded on the facets of feminine attraction, addressing the female as the epitome of sensuality and male desire. Solid and lucid in heavily outlined forms, the female body has been playfully compressed within her pictorial frame to be experienced in its corporeal fullness. In soft glowing colours, she portrayed women as silent victims in patriarchal structures, their limp limbs, tilted heads and folded hands suggesting their helplessness.\nPal\u2019s work features in major museum collections in Japan, the Netherlands and Poland. Among the honours she has received are the Sanskriti Award, 1980, a Lalit Kala Akademi fellowship in 1981-82, a junior fellowship from the Department of Culture, Government of India, 1986-88, and the national award from the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1990. She passed away in 2024 in New Delhi.",

    "bio": "His art training began at the Maharaja School of Arts, Jaipur.\u00a0From 1935-38, Ghose studied at the Government College of Art and Craft, Madras. Once, while painting on the Marina beach in Madras, he caught the attention of C. Rajagopalachari\u2014statesman, activist, writer and leader of the Indian National Congress\u2014who offered to arrange his further studies abroad, which the college authorities, however, did not permit.\nTrained in the style of the neo-Bengal School\u00a0under Sailendranath Dey, Abanindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose and D. P. Roy Chowdhury, Ghose also studied sculpture at Maharaja School of Arts, Jaipur. On his return to Calcutta in 1943, the artist and his contemporaries formed Calcutta Group, the first such group of modern Indian artists.\u00a0The group held exhibitions from 1945 onwards and organised a joint show in 1950 with the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group in Bombay.\nGhose\u2019s paintings from 1940-47 are like a visual catalogue of atrocities, revealing the pain and despair caused by man-made cruelties. Public acceptance came to him in 1952, after his first solo exhibition at No. 1 Chowringhee Terrace, Calcutta. From 1950-72, Ghose taught at Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta. Dexterous in handling watercolour, tempera, pen and ink, and pastels, Ghose became a legend in his lifetime for reinterpreting the genre of landscape painting. He passed away on 30 July 1980.",

    "bio": "Chinnery trained at London\u2019s Royal Academy Schools, where one of England\u2019s greatest landscapists, J. M. W. Turner, was a contemporary. At the age of twenty-two, Chinnery went to Dublin to establish his career and attained early success. He married his landlord\u2019s daughter, Marianne, but sailed for India in 1802 to seek portrait commissions, leaving his wife and two children behind. \n Within a decade of arriving in India, Chinnery established himself as a leading English artist, making handsome profits by creating portraits of Indian and Western patrons in Calcutta. Though he was financially successful as an artist, he was a spendthrift too, and ran up debts, which forced him to leave India in 1825 and settle down in Macao. In Macao, made cosmopolitan by the population of Portuguese, other European and North American merchants, Chinnery settled well, finding clients and friends. He made portraits of the leading Chinese merchants, as also of Westerners and Parsis, many of whom were leaders of tea, cotton and opium trades. \n Chinnery never returned to India or to Britain (his wife had eventually followed him to India), enjoying artistic success in Macao, Canton (present-day Guangzhou), and Hong Kong. His works are in important private and public collections around the world, including the Museum of Macao and the Macao Museum of Art. He passed away in Macao on 30 May 1852.",

    "bio": "A national scholarship awardee in painting for three years from the Government of India, Sanyal was a founder member of Calcutta Painters and had exhibited at its inaugural group show at All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, in 1963; he was also a lecturer in fine arts.\nDrawings and decorative architectonic representations formed a major part of his works, with human parables, animals, roadside life, and itinerant musicians as subjects. Drawing always remained a stronger interest for Sanyal than painting, but that he did not avoid the latter was evident from his passion and skill for colour.\nA sound knowledge of anatomy came through in his distortions of form, as did a Cezanne-ian sophistication of composition. Most of his drawings and mixed media works featured common people, bird sellers and Baul musicians, revealing his empathy for hardworking, poor folk outside the pale of regular society.\nHe received awards from the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, in 1963, and the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, in 1964 and \u201971. His works are included in important collections of the Chicago University, Natraj Gallery in Texas, National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, and the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata, to name a few. Sanyal was also the subject of a 1993 film by Debiprasad Ghosh.",

    "name": "Gaganendranath Tagore",
    "year": "1867 - 1938",
    "intro": "The true pioneer of cubism in India and acclaimed for his satirical works of art, Gaganendranath Tagore was born on 17 September 1867.",
    "bio": "Along with his Nobel-laureate uncle Rabindranath Tagore, and brother Abanindranath Tagore, he was at the forefront of cultural revival in Bengal in the early twentieth century; the brothers established the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta, in 1907.\nA self-taught artist, Tagore began painting late, at the age of thirty-eight. He learnt Japanese brushwork from visiting Japanese artists at Santiniketan. Initially, he painted Puri landscapes, portraits and other figurative sketches, scenes of Calcutta and illustrations for Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s My Reminiscences, consisting of early known works Sibu Kirtania and Crows. In 1914, six of his paintings were sent to London, and then to the Pavilion Marson exhibition in Paris. Following this, cubism was introduced in his works. From 1917, he also published portfolios of cartoons, titled Birupa Bajra, Adbhut Lok, and Baba Hullod, which were merciless satires on contemporary Bengal society.\nHe was also the driving force behind the Vichitra club at the Tagore residence, even acquiring a lithographic press for it. He tried his hand\u2014to enormous success\u2014at each popular style of painting\u2014watercolour landscapes, haunting night scenes, several Bengal School washes and Japanese brushwork.\nHis 1923 exhibition in Berlin and Hamburg received praise from German critics. He used form as a medium to communicate his feelings, and emphasised the structural quality in his works through semi-abstraction.\nTagore passed away on 14 February 1938.",

    "bio": "His father\u2019s death forced a young Gulam to work as a signboard painter, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 artist, and weaver. He learnt to paint watercolour landscapes from Dina Nath Raina in Kashmir before studying under N. S. Bendre at M. S. University, Baroda, on the recommendation of S. H. Raza. In Baroda, he produced a large body of figurative and landscape works, mainly in the cubist style.\nIn Kashmir, Santosh found inspiration in the Hindu and Buddhist tantric cults that had coexisted with the region\u2019s Sufi mysticism for centuries. At the Amarnath cave in Kashmir in 1964, Santosh had a deeply spiritual experience that turned him towards\u00a0the philosophy of tantra. Driven by the primordial\u00a0purusha-prakriti\u00a0concept of cosmic creation, he expressed the fusion of the sexual and the transcendental in his works and pioneered the neo-tantra school. An acclaimed writer and poet in Kashmiri and Urdu, Santosh wrote on tantric philosophy in English as well.\nSantosh was awarded the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award thrice, in 1957, 1964 and 1973, the Kala Ratna Award by All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, in 1991, and received the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 1977. He also won the Sahitya Akademi award for his collection of poems, Besukh Ruh, in 1979.  He passed away on 10 March 1997.",

    "intro": "Born in Jamalpur in present day Bangladesh on 9 February 1936, Ganesh Haloi migrated with his family to Calcutta upon Partition.",
    "bio": "From 1952-56, he studied at the city\u2019s Government College of Arts and Crafts, where he acquired his personal style of sophisticated elegance and finish. Upon graduation, he joined the Archaeological Survey of India and was assigned the documentation of the cave paintings of Ajanta from 1957-63.\nAt around the same time he began his artistic career primarily as a painter of landscapes. The picturesque landscapes of a homeland imprinted as childhood memories inspired his imagery of tender, verdant, moisture-laden vistas in his paintings. Human presence was erased from his visual panorama, giving way to a sublime conversation between land and sky, air and water. By the mid-1970s, Haloi was acknowledged as an accomplished landscape painter who could evoke metaphysical essences within an ordinary landscape.\nThe transformation that began in the \u201970s consolidated in the\u00a0Metascape\u00a0series of 1978, which demarcated a gradual transition from realism to abstraction. Since then, Haloi has made a significant contribution in building up a trend in contemporary painting of using abstract vocabulary to depict nature that goes beyond visual documentation, yet conveys the poetry of nature.\nThe artist, who lives in Kolkata, has received many honours such as seven gold medals from the Academy of Fine Arts, seven silver medals from the University of Calcutta, the Rabindra Bharati award, and the Shiromani Puraskar, among others.",

University, Baroda, in 1971-72, on a Lalit Kala Akademi fellowship.\nCalendar art and mythological scenes painted on scrolls and village walls informed his earliest art. His village\u2019s egalitarian social structure, with no marked distinctions of caste or other divisions, has been a lasting inspiration; its rustic beauty and resilient farmers, labourers and women his frequent subjects, engaged in simple, daily activities.\nBright, primary colours evoking nature, rendered in fine brushstrokes, bring to life his sensuously-rendered women and their lustrous dark skin and sturdy bodies that are hardened by labour but also decorated in jewellery and flowers. It is his way of recalling the childhood memory of watching male artistes impersonating female characters for theatre groups in his village. Another source of Vaikuntam\u2019s inspiration is the children\u2019s cultural centre in Hyderabad, Jawahar Bal Bhavan, where he spent fifteen years as an art teacher.\nA celebrated artist, Vaikuntam has also done art direction for films; among others, he was art director for the 1988-89 Telugu film Dasi, which won a national award.

The riots ensuing Partition the same year affected the young artist, appearing in his later works such as\u00a0Falling Figures. The anguish of the disenfranchised, and the reinterpretation of mythological figures, were his frequent tropes. Referred to sometimes as the Francis Bacon of India, Mehta\u2019s use of primary colours and bold outlines resulted in a language in which opposing forces are represented figuratively, without moral judgement, but symbolic of horror and violence.\nMehta mostly lived in Mumbai except for\u00a0short stints\u00a0in London, New York\u00a0(on a John D.

Like many other Europeans at that time, he was drawn to India by stories of its wealth and possibilities of painting the exotica\u2014chiefly in the wake of the landscapist William Hodges\u2014and in 1784 obtained permission from the East India Company to travel to Calcutta as an engraver, accompanied by his nephew as his assistant.\nThe Daniells arrived in India in 1785 and over the next ten years, travelled extensively, sketching and painting sceneries, people and customs, architecture and ruins, flora and fauna. They travelled across the Himalayas, along the river Ganga, through the mountains and jungles of the south, as well as the Presidency cities of Calcutta and Madras.\nUpon their return to England,\u202fthe\u202fDaniells made several aquatints from the drawings they had amassed, brought together in\u202fa\u202fcollection\u202fof one hundred and forty prints\u202fissued\u202fin\u202fsix volumes from 1795 to 1808,\u202fcollectively called\u202fOriental Scenery, a publication that achieved great success.\u202fThey published aquatints on Calcutta too, titled Views of Calcutta.",

    "intro": "British draughtsman, lithographer, watercolourist, journalist, and antiquarian, William Simpson was born on 28 October 1823 in Glasgow, Scotland. He is best remembered for his sketches of various wars made for the Illustrated London News.",
    "bio": "Simpson\u2019s early years were difficult as he was born in poverty. In 1834, he was sent to Perth, Australia, to live with his grandmother, which allowed him a chance at formal schooling. Returning to Scotland, he worked as an apprentice in the Glasgow lithographic firm of Macfarlane, and also attended the Andersonian University and the Mechanics Institute in the evenings. He would call this time a \u2018turning point\u2019 in his life.\nAs a journalist, Simpson covered the Crimean War (1853-56) and soon joined the Illustrated London News for which he covered the Abyssinian campaign (1868), Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Modoc War (1873) and the Second Afghan War (1878). He first came to India in 1859, sent by the publisher William Day to work on a large-scale illustrated work showing the country in the wake of the 1857 Mutiny. The project was wrecked with the publisher\u2019s bankruptcy. In 1875-76, Simpson accompanied the Prince of Wales on his tour of India. Throughout his travels in the subcontinent, Simpson kept sketchbooks that contributed to his magnum opus, An Album of Sketches of India, Rajpootana, Himalayas and Tibet.\nA number of Simpson\u2019s watercolours made on foreign travels are in London\u2019s British Museum, along with a small number of archaeological and ethnographic items he collected. Simpson passed away on 17 August 1899 in London.",

    "bio": "Born on 28 October 1744 in London, he studied painting under William Shipley, and, later, under Richard Wilson, \u2018the father of British landscape\u2019. Initially, he made a living painting backdrops for plays. But he was an established landscape painter by the time he joined explorer James Cook\u2019s second voyage across the Pacific Ocean in 1772-75 as an expedition artist. This voyage resulted in several landscapes of various Pacific islands, among them, famously, Tahiti. \n Hodges was the first of the British artists to arrive in India in search of work, followed by several others, the most notable of whom were the Daniells. In India, Hodges painted several private commissions as well as those for the East India Company, patronised particularly by Governor Warren Hastings. \n Hodges travelled widely in India, in particular along the river Ganga, and sketched places like Agra, Allahabad, Banaras, and Lucknow, providing the first-ever visual depictions of India based on first-hand observation. Upon his return to England, Hodges published a series of forty-eight aquatints under the title Select Views of India, and Travels in India, 1780...1783, ten years after his return\u2014a fascinating account of his travels in the subcontinent, accompanied by sketches. \n Hodges was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1789.

It was in his modest studio in Bombay that aspiring artists and intellectuals such as von Leyden, Emmanuel Schlesinger, among others mingled and discussed modern art movements. His own work was in a style reminiscent of German expressionism and it was the vibrancy of India that gave his art a new impetus. \u2018I\u2019m in it for colour,\u2019 is what he told friend and art critic von Leyden.\nIn 1938, Langhammer became chairman of Bombay Art Society; from 1952-53, he was a committee member of the diamond jubilee exhibition of the Society. He worked in collaboration with Kekoo Gandhy in designing frames for paintings at Chemould Frames, later renamed Gallery Chemould.\nLanghammer returned to Europe with his wife in the 1970s, continuing to paint, guide, and impact artists through his writings and other work.

    "bio": "Born on 1 June 1860 in Bridport, England, Bartlett was educated at the famous public school, Clifton, and worked at a metallurgy firm in Bristol before joining the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He moved next to Paris to study under Jules-Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. It was the Orientalist paintings of Boulanger that provided an impetus for Bartlett\u2019s travels through Asia later on. He was using a variety of techniques, including oil painting, watercolours, etching, and drypoint at this time.\nIn 1889, grief-stricken upon the death of his wife and child in childbirth, Bartlett travelled through France and Italy with British artist Frank Brangwyn, who introduced him to Japanese woodblock (ukiyo-e) prints. He settled in The Netherlands for a while and his reputation as a watercolourist soared. In December 1913, Bartlett embarked on a tour of Asia with his second wife Catherine, travelling through India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, China, and Japan. Arriving in Japan in 1915, he was introduced to Watanabe Shozaburo, a print publisher who was a major force in Shin-Hanga (syncretic ukiyo-e) movement. Watanabe urged Bartlett to train in ukiyo-e, and the two embarked on a successful collaboration, creating prints comprising six scenes from India and Japan each.\nLeaving Japan in 1917, Bartlett stopped in Honolulu in Hawaii for a one-man show but, smitten by the island, dropped anchor to spend the rest of his life there. He passed away in Honolulu in 1940.",

    "bio": "This led the Company to invite several landscape and portrait artists from Europe and later, mainly Britain, to paint India.\nBeginning with portraitist Tilly Kettle, and soon after by landscapist William Hodges, over the next century these artists painted extensively for the Company as well as for private patrons. Charles d\u2019Oyly\u2019s Views of Calcutta and its Environs, Thomas and William Daniells\u2019 Oriental Scenery, and F. B. Solvyns\u2019s The Costumes of Hindoostan and later, the Peoples of India series, shone light on India, her landscapes and lifestyles, for people in Europe.\nIn their wake, the Company commissioned artists to paint cities, monuments, flora and fauna, and recorded physiognomies, costumes and festivals of the people of India. Together, these paintings came to be regarded as the Company School.\nA large number of Company painters were anonymous Indian artists and artisans from the impoverished courts of Murshidabad, Lucknow and Patna, and declining miniature schools, drawn into the service of European artists. Many of these paintings, aquatints and drawings featured in publications that were all the rage in Britain. Indians who painted in this style created an amalgamation of India\u2019s miniature tradition and Western naturalist technique, incorporating European elements of depth and salon art features such as draperies and studio backdrops. Gradually, these paintings became frozen embodiments of colonial notions of Indian life, thus reducing the artists to artisans.",

    "intro": "A self-taught artist, poet, storyteller, and an active member of the Communist Party of India, Chittaprosad was born on 21 June 1915.",
    "bio": "Chittaprosad drew inspiration from village sculptors, artisans and puppeteers. The devastating Bengal famine of 1943-44 resulted in\u00a0his brutally honest depiction of\u00a0human suffering in stark drawings and sketches made in pen\u00a0and ink. These drawings and reports were published in\u00a0People\u2019s War, and culminated in\u00a0Hungry Bengal, a shocking eyewitness report on the man-made tragedy, copies of which were seized and destroyed by the British.\nPowerful and emotive, his art of caricature emerged as a statement in favour of the oppressed masses, and as a forceful denunciation of the tyranny of the ruling class and indictment of the prevailing conditions. Underlying the biting humour was a compassionate humanism and his images were essentially an appeal on behalf of the marginalised.\nApart from his body of works representing human suffering, Chittaprosad did several landscapes and cityscapes, portraits, female figures, nudes, still-lifes, and illustrations for books, while based in Bombay in the later years of his life. A defining moment was his meeting with Frantisek Salaba, a Czech puppeteer who lived briefly in Bombay. This association led to the making of a film on Chittaprosad\u2019s life, titled Confession, by Pavel Hoble in 1972. It won a special prize from the World Peace Council. Chittaprosad relocated to Calcutta in the last years of his life where he passed away on 13 November 1978.",

    "bio": "Moving in the early 1990s to Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village, set up by K. C. S. Paniker, Douglas came to be known for his works that were considered both expressionist and anthropocentric.\nGraduating from the Government College of Art and Craft, Madras, in the \u201970s, Douglas\u2019s art evolved as a process of deep introspection, influenced by both the narrative and the fantastical elements in the art of the master artists that he\u2019d encountered in his college and on his trips abroad. In the \u201980s, in Germany, where he\u2019d moved after getting married to a theatre artiste he met at Max Mueller Bhavan in Madras, he experienced closer interaction with expressionism and Bauhaus.\nBelieving that \u2018art is about wounds\u2019, Douglas, in the course of his prolific artistic career, has experimented with various mediums, particularly paper, testing its texture by crumpling, burning, even bathing it several times in water to make it more malleable.\nDouglas has received several awards and grants in the course of his career, including the national award from the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, in 1992. In 1991-93 and 1994-96 he received cultural fellowships from the Government of India. In 1994, he was awarded the Charles Wallace Grant to study ceramics in the Netherlands.\nHe continues to live and work in Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village, Chennai.",

Moving between jobs for a few years in his new homeland, Sadequain devoted himself fully to the arts in 1955 after his fame as an artist rose with the patronage of the country\u2019s prime minister, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy.\nIt was around this time that two important characteristics of Sadequain\u2019s art started taking concrete shape\u2014the influence of Pablo Picasso in his figurative works, and the trope of the cactii, used as a metaphor for human struggle. The thorny plant even became part of his calligraphic work, which was the source of all his art.\nAt the 1961 Paris Biennale, Sadequain was declared an artist laureate in the \u2018Under 35\u2019 category and awarded a scholarship, which allowed him to travel across Europe and the U.S. and hold solo exhibitions in London and Paris. Post his return to Pakistan in 1967, Sadequain started focusing mostly on calligraphy. He was also commissioned by the state to make murals for important buildings such as the ceiling of Frere Hall in Karachi, and the State Bank of Pakistan building. Sadequain passed away in Karachi on 10 February 1987.",

Upon graduation, he taught art and served as the art director of the Imperial Tobacco Company before moving to Paris in 1937-38, where he was highly influenced by Henri Matisse.\nMookherjea worked in oil in an easy expressionist style that set him apart from his Indian contemporaries, most of whom were working in watercolour washes, thus emerging as one of India\u2019s earliest modernists. He bore no affinity to the beliefs of any popular contemporary style and drew on the diverse influences of Indian miniature tradition and the Paris school. His paintings sought to bring back visualisations of  idyllic rural life in contemporary urban imagination through depictions of lived reality. His later landscapes showed a shift towards disintegration of form.\nMookherjea was highly influential as a teacher, training future greats such as Ram Kumar and J. Swaminathan; he taught at Sarada Ukil School of Art in New Delhi from 1945-47, and at Delhi Polytechnic from 1948-60. His works are part of important collections including Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata, the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, and the Jehangir Nicholson Gallery, Mumbai.

    "intro": "Beset by problems and politics, but possessing great potential, Kolkata has remained Shuvaprasanna's abiding inspiration as he absorbs and responds to its upheavals, the tumult of its masses, and its frequent political turbulence.",
    "bio": "Born in Calcutta on 20 October 1947, he is a quintessential painter of the eastern metropolis that he unabashedly loves. He graduated from Indian College of Art, Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta, in 1969. An active member of Calcutta Painters group, urban themes are a constant in his work.\nSkilled in painting, etching, and drawing in mixed media, his artistic and personal concerns lie with urban decay and an anxiety of the collapse of urban culture, seen in his well-known works featuring crows and owls, and the series Illusion, Clock and Bird. This is also visible in his cityscapes which are curiously devoid of human presence; empty lanes and bylanes speak of the absence of the multitudes that populate this crowded city.\nIn 1984, he founded Arts Acre, an artists\u2019 village in Calcutta, and has worked as editor of Art Today magazine. Awarded by institutions like Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Kolkata, Lalit Kala Akademi, West Bengal, and All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, New Delhi, he was the subject of a documentary film by Goutam Ghose, titled Shuva and Me, in which the two visited Germany to meet German Nobel-laureate G\u00fcnter Grass. Shuvaprasanna continues to live and work in Kolkata with his artist wife Shipra Bhattacharya.",

    "intro": "Sudhir Ranjan Khastgir was one of those modernists from Bengal who, despite being trained in Santiniketan, did not bear affinity to its artistic credos, nor to any other prevalent style.",
    "bio": "Born on 24 September 1907 in Chittagong in present-day Bangladesh, he studied at Kala Bhavana, Santiniketan, under Nandalal Bose. Like his classmate, Ramkinkar Baij, he took up sculpture as a subject, continuing its pursuit in Lucknow under Hiranmoy Roychaudhuri in 1932, and under Ganpath Kashinath Mahatre, in Bombay, in 1933. The same year, he joined Scindia School, Gwalior, as a teacher and, later, Doon School in Dehradun.\nWhile still a teacher, Khastgir went to Deutsch Academy, Munich, in 1937, for his postgraduation. In 1947, his solo exhibition in London at Imperial Institute was opened by eminent sculptor Eric Gill. In 1956, he became principal of Government College of Arts and Crafts, Lucknow, from where he retired in 1962.\nLike Baij, Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury, and Chintamoni Kar, Khastgir too was a painter-sculptor and did portraits of several eminent personalities, including Rabindranath Tagore and Jawaharlal Nehru. His sculptural compositions included themes from the real and the mythical world. In his paintings, he idealised the toilers of land and captured the beauty of landscapes, but also drew from a historical past.\nIn 1957, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. Khastgir passed away on 6 June 1974, in Calcutta.",

    "bio": "Born in Calcutta, Sakti Burman studied at the city\u2019s Government College of Arts and Crafts, and later at \u00c9cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts, Paris.\nPointillism and a marbling effect are unique characteristics of Burman\u2019s art. He discovered marbling accidentally when water spilled on an oil canvas caused a filigreed dispersal of oil, an effect he has been painstakingly recreating ever since. Incredibly, he brought the same effect to his prints, made in his initial years, achieving the marbling on the surface of the medium\u2014stone or wood or metal\u2014through a labourious technical process in close collaboration with his printmakers, incidentally, also employed by Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. In 1958, exposure to Italian Renaissance frescos by Giotto, Piero della Francesca and Simone Martini inspired Burman to incorporate the monumentality and texture of their works in his oeuvre.\nIndia continues to inhabit his work in the form of characters and episodes from mythology or popular culture, often alluding to Ajanta cave paintings. Birds and animals, dream imagery and mythological figures such as Shiva\u2019s son Kartikeya, referenced as the peacock-riding man, are frequent occurrences, making his work appear surrealist. For a long time now, he has foregrounded the figurative, which had receded from the art scenario in recent decades.\nBurman is married to French artist Maite Deiteil and spends his time between his homes and studios in Paris and New Delhi.",

He was a student of renowned sculptor Ramkinkar Baij, known for using unconventional materials such as cement for making sculptures. Accompanying Baij on a trip to Nepal to execute a war memorial, Chaudhuri learnt Nepali metal casting. In 1949, he went on a study tour of Europe, visiting art centres in England, France, Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands.\nChaudhuri is best known for his simple, flowing sculptures. He has constantly experimented with material: using clay, terracotta, plaster, and cement, stone, wood, copper, brass, and aluminium. His sculptures often consist of entwined forms that create a harmonious rhythm in their balanced stances. Clear lines accentuate the form in his work.\nHe received the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1956 and the Lalit Kala Ratna honour in 2004. He was honoured with the Padma Shri in 1971. Some of his well-known works are Music for All India Radio in 1957, bronze statues of Mahatma Gandhi exhibited in Rio de Janeiro in 1964 and Copenhagen in 1986, among others.

School of Art, Bombay (1943-47), and one of the first members of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, the turning point of his career was his journey to Paris in 1950 on a French government scholarship to study at \u00c9cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts. In 1956, he became the first non-French artist to win the critic\u2019s award, the Prix de la critique.\nRaza almost exclusively excluded the human figure from his vocabulary, choosing landscapes instead. In the 1960s, he drifted away from realistic landscapes towards \u2018gestural expressionism\u2019, a form of abstraction. Ultimately, Raza\u2019s paintings evolved from his childhood memories of dense forests and the river Narmada, the bright colours of the Indian market, as if drawn towards the black dot\u2014the bindu\u2014drawn by his schoolteacher as an attempt to help him focus and meditate. The imagery transmuted into geometrical lines and intense bursts of colour on canvas in a geometrical exploration of tantra.\nAmong prominent honours, Raza received the Kalidas Samman, Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s Lalit Kala Ratna, and the Indian government\u2019s Padma Shri, and Padma Bhushan. His works are among the most high valued works at auctions of Indian art.\nAfter living in France for six decades, Raza shifted to New Delhi in 2010, where he passed away on 23 July 2016.",

    "bio": "Born in Purulia in West Bengal, Sunil Madhav Sen was a self-taught artist. Though he learned drawing as a child from a local teacher, he studied law and the liberal arts at Calcutta University and worked for the government. He pursued his passion for art privately alongside his legal practise, visiting the studios of Abanindranath Tagore, Atul Bose, J. P. Gangooly, and Satish Sinha. He also apprenticed for two years under Hemendranath Mazumdar, honing his skills in portrait painting.\nIn his initial years as an artist, Sen made charcoal studies of figures and animals, painted portraits, and made copies of the works of old European masters such as Italian Baroque artist Guido Reni, Dutch master Rembrandt, and sixteenth century Greek artist El Greco. Holding his first solo show in 1950, Sen joined the seminal Calcutta Group in 1952, which was founded in 1943 as a rejection of the Bengal School, and believed in painting the social and political reality of the times.\nHis subjects were Nepalese women, Bhutia boys, ordinary life, the dispossessed, the Quit India movement, the Bengal famine, gods and goddesses, and the terror and beauty of children\u2019s dreams. His works are part of collections at National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, Library of Congress, U.S.A., New York Public Library, and Bradford Museum.",

He eventually became principal of his alma mater in 1972.\nDhanapal studied ancient Indian sculptures for their thematic divisions, techniques, iconography, and iconometry, particularly the grammar of Chola, Pallava as well as Mathura sculptures of the Gandhara School.\nMassive and robust, his sculptures retained the fullness of a three-dimensional form. He experimented with various metals, terracotta and wood with a great command over each medium, exploring varied themes ranging from the biblical and mythological to nudes, portraits and narratives.\nBesides being an acclaimed visual artist, Dhanapal also attained fame as a performing artiste\u2014he was an accomplished Bharatanatyam dancer and was part of several dance-drama productions on stage; he learnt the classical dance forms of Kathakali and Kathak too.\nDhanapal won the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1962; the Akademi\u2019s regional centre in Chennai held his retrospective in 2001, a year after he passed away.",

Nandagopal\u2019s tryst with art, unsurprisingly, began early on. Just like his father, Nandagopal\u2019s work was a synthesis of tradition and modernity.",
    "bio": "The folk trope in his \u2018pictorial sculptures\u2019 was unmistakable. His workmanship, wherein the artist employed copper and brass with silver plating, adding enamelling judiciously for a touch of colour, allowed his artistic oeuvre to evolve further. The beating of the metal sheet and the exercise of cutting, welding, drilling, and hammering, was a meditative process for him.\nFollowing a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics in 1966 from the University of Madras, he secured a diploma in fine arts from the Government College of Fine Art, Madras, in 1971. In the same decade, he moved to Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village with his family.\nA recipient of several honours, Nandagopal was awarded the prestigious Lalit Kala Akademi award in the years 1970 and 1978. He was a gold medallist at the fourth International Triennale in New Delhi in 1978. In 2002, he received the Jindal Stainless Steel Award for Sculpture. He was also a recipient of the Homi Bhabha fellowship (1980), the British Council travel grant and the Indian Council for Cultural Relationships travel grant, both in the \u201980s, and the Government of India senior fellowship (1990).\nIn 2017, he succumbed to a cardiac arrest at the age of seventy-one at his residence in Cholamandal Artists' Village.",

    "bio": "He was born in a wealthy farming family in Punjab\u2019s Chachoki village on 2 November 1932.  When he was seven, he came across two spiritualists living on the family farm\u2014Bikham Giri, a Bengali Tantric-Vajrayan Yogi, and Ahmed Ali Shah Qadri, a\u00a0Sufi. Both gurus had a tremendous impact on young Qadri and taught him spiritual ideals through meditation, dance, and music. His association with them heralded a lifelong commitment to spirituality and art.\nEscaping from farming, young Qadri first fled to the Himalayas and then made his way into Tibet, staying in monasteries for several months. On being compelled to return, he took up painting. In 1965, Qadri left India and embarked on travels across the globe, eventually settling in Copenhagen, where he painted and taught yoga.\nRepresentation disappeared from Qadri\u2019s visual language early on. In search of transcendence, he created works imbued with tantric symbolism and philosophy, giving rise to his own abstract, modernist vocabulary. His art was minimalist, rendered in vibrant colours, almost an allusion to the northern lights of Scandinavia.\nQadri began his career painting with oils on canvas but from the 1970s  onwards, he started working on paper\u2014soaking it, carving it, and covering it in dyes, turning the two-dimensional surface into a three-dimensional medium.\nHis works are part of prominent collections globally and in India. He passed away in Toronto, Canada, on 2 March 2011.",

He joined the British Indian army as a draughtsman and continued to learn from studying the works of English and European artists.\nOn quitting the army in 1923, he settled in Amritsar where he also opened his studio. Moving between Amritsar, Lahore, and Delhi, over the next two decades, he continued to paint and participate in exhibitions, earning a reputation as a portrait painter. In 1946, he found employment as an art director in Lahore for a film, but Partition forced him to move again. He finally settled down in the artists\u2019 village of Andretta in Himachal Pradesh.\nPainting images of the Sikh gurus remained his prime focus as an artist, but he also made other portraits of freedom fighters, heroes of the Indian army, as also characters from popular folk stories of Punjab such as Heer-Ranjha. He also executed landscapes and sculptures.\nSingh was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India that also commissioned a documentary on his life, Painter of People, to mark his seventy-fifth birthday. He passed away on 22 August 1986 in Chandigarh. His family continues to run the Sobha Singh Art Gallery and Museum in Andretta.",

    "intro": "Shobha Broota\u2019s pictorial interpretation of the resonance of classical Indian ragas forms the essence of her celebrated style in which she conveys their subtle variations through minimal use of colours.",
    "bio": "Born in 1943 in New Delhi in an artistic family that inspired her to study art, she obtained a diploma in painting from College of Art, New Delhi, in 1964.\nIn her early phase, Broota worked across genres and engaged with various mediums. She did portraits, figurative and abstract paintings, and experimented extensively with the abstract in printmaking before arriving at her philosophically rendered, meditative canvases. Her etchings and woodcuts reveal a bold use of colour and the early attempts at an abstract imagery to capture the esoteric, if not yet serenely meditative, realms of her imagination.\nBroota has since developed her art into a form of meditation, as she believes that the blank canvas must be approached with a clean and uncluttered mind. Some of her recent exhibitions,\u00a0\u2018A Path Beyond\u2019,\u00a0\u2018Edge of Infinity\u2019,\u00a0\u2018Song of the Divine\u2019,\u00a0\u2018Music of the Spheres\u2019, and \u2018Sutra\u2019, reflect the artist\u2019s deeper exploration of her style and, increasingly mediums that incorporate string, wool and other materials.\nBroota has exhibited her works at numerous national and international exhibitions and workshops, and has received important fellowships of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. She received the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society award in 1982, and another award from Sahitya Kala Parishad in 1986. She lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "year": "1934 - 2005",
    "intro": "Laden with satire and wit,\u00a0and often subtly political, Shyamal Dutta Ray's work communicated his preoccupation with the human condition.",
    "bio": "Among the most accomplished watercolourists of modern India, he was born in Ranchi, then in Bihar, and studied at Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, from 1950-55. He was a founding member of Society of Contemporary Artists in 1959, and of Painters 80, founded in 1968.\nDutta Ray suffered from severe ill-health while growing up and witnessed the horrors of the 1943 Bengal famine as a child, both of which impacted his life and art tremendously. He began his career working in oil but had to switch to watercolour on medical advice as he was allergic to oil paints. Dutta Ray became a master of the demanding medium of watercolour and brought about a major development in its application by using saturated hues instead of the diluted colours prevalent among his contemporaries. He painted the contradictory contemporary reality of Calcutta, filled with sorrow, poverty, despair, as also happiness, and hope.\nThe masterful depiction of pathos in watercolours won him several awards within India and abroad including the gold medal of Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, in 1958, the Rabindra Bharati University award in 1968, several annual awards of the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Calcutta, Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1982, and the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath award and the Shiromani Puraskar, both in 1988. He passed away in 2005.",

Yet, he pursued his passion for the arts with the support of his mother and studied at Indian College of Arts and Draughtsmanship, Calcutta, where he would eventually return as college principal.\nThough Roy came to be known for his Radha series of paintings later in his career, he practiced printmaking and glass painting too, and created art on a variety of subjects. The protagonist is the mythic embodiment of feminine beauty, born out of his belief in the need for beauty in art.\nUpon graduation, Roy went to Paris on a scholarship with fellow artists Jogen Chowdhury and Dipak Bannerjee, where he studied graphic arts under S. W. Hayter at Atelier 17 and mural art at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts. A month spent in southern Europe visiting churches inspired his series on Jesus Christ in a variety of mediums. He also incorporated elements from the minimalist works of Japanese artist Taikan in his landscapes. Besides, he captured the political turbulence in Bengal during the Naxalite movement through his Disaster series.\nRoy, who retired as professor of painting at Santiniketan\u2019s Kala Bhavana, passed away in Kolkata on October 18 2016.",

    "bio": "Born on 15 August 1894 in the north Calcutta neighbourhood of Nather Bagan, Sinha showed an aptitude for the arts since childhood. He enrolled at the Government School of Art at the age of eighteen as a pupil of Abanindranath Tagore. However, he had to give up studying within three years due to his father\u2019s death. He joined an insurance company as an agent to earn his livelihood but continued to study painting privately.\nSoon, he was illustrating books, magazines and journals, such as the Bengali periodical Basumati. Though he had been a student of Abanindranath Tagore, Sinha gradually found his own style in realism, and along with other students of Tagore such as Jamini Roy and Atul Bose, drifted away from the Bengal School. He also interned with Hemendranath Mazumdar at Jubilee Art Academy.\nIn later years, Sinha went on to teach at his alma mater. He also taught at Indian College of Arts and Draughtsmanship, where he was eventually elevated to the post of principal. Sinha was an active member of the Calcutta cultural collective called Rasachakra and served as joint secretary at New Delhi\u2019s Lalit Kala Akademi. He was awarded the ivory Ashok Stambha in 1962 by the Government of India for his contribution to Indian art.",

Encouraged by his parents, he obtained a diploma in fine arts from the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Lucknow, in 1960.\nAs a teenager, Chatterjee had met Asit Kumar Haldar, a major pioneer of the Bengal School. For fourteen years, Chatterjee trained under Haldar, the principal of his art school. He also studied under Kshitindranath Majumdar in Allahabad.\nHowever, Chatterjee gradually evolved his own style and became especially renowned for his watercolour on silk paintings in the wash technique, some of which were gigantic scrolls. One of these, measuring 100 ft x 11 ft, entered the Guinness Book of World Records in 1998 as the world\u2019s longest painting. It details the concept of Mahashakti, the feminine principle of the Hindu concept of creation, preservation, and destruction, interspersed with zodiac signs from Hindu astrology. Besides being a painter, sculptor, poet, and musician, Chatterjee dabbled in astrology too.\nOn Haldar\u2019s advice, Chatterjee shifted to Simla early in his career, serving as the head of the fine arts department at its Government College for several years. He passed away on 11 April 2017 in Simla.",

    "intro": "Somnath Hore was the quintessential Bengal artist deeply affected by the cataclysms that changed its history, such as the 1943 famine\u2014a man-made crisis resulting in the death of two-three million people\u2014and the 1946 Tebhaga peasant uprising.",
    "bio": "A multifaceted artist who spent a lifetime exploring human suffering through his sketches, prints and sculptures, Somnath Hore was born in Chittagong in present-day Bangladesh in 1921.\nStudying briefly at Government School of Art, Calcutta, in the mid-1940s, Hore trained under Zainul Abedin, and, later, under printmaker Saifuddin Ahmed. A participatory practice with fellow artists like Chittaprosad led to his intellectual growth. Hore\u2019s early sketches were published in\u00a0Janayuddha\u00a0and\u00a0People\u2019s War, publications of the Communist Party; like many young men in the 1940s, Hore too joined the political party though he drifted away from it later.\nHore chose a distinctly formal, Western style of artmaking, distinguished by its strong linear quality, and guided by humanist concerns that foregrounded the indigent grappling with issues of survival. Distilled into iconic heads and emaciated bodies, his act of recovering the erased re-inscribed them into public memory. The anguished human form was reflected in Hore\u2019s figuration through bold, minimal strokes enhanced by rough surfaces, slits and holes.\nOver a thirty-year teaching career, Hore set up the printmaking department of Delhi Polytechnic in 1958. He joined Kala Bhavana, Santiniketan, as head of its printmaking department in 1968, where his own practice received a boost under the guidance of Ramkinkar Baij and Benodebehari Mukherjee.",

    "intro": "Born in Mysore, S. G. Vasudev completed his diploma in fine arts, from Government College of Art and Craft, Madras, in 1968, where he was deeply influenced by artist-teacher K. C. S. Paniker. While still a student, he won Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1967.",
    "bio": "Vasudev became popular with his Vriksha series of the 1970s that further evolved into the Mithuna series that examined vegetal and human sexual imagery. His exploration of themes resulted in his well-known works belonging to the He & She series, Hayavadana, Ganesha, and humanscapes. Vasudev has also worked closely with master weavers to create tapestries in silk featuring the themes he has been exploring over the years. Besides, he has made copper engravings, beaten metal objects, and batik style painting on cloth as well as canvases. In the early days, his works were done in heavy impasto. Later, however, Vasudev realised he could integrate the linear impulse that is the most significant aspect of the south Indian style, with both colour and lyricism. Simple geometrical shapes provide a frame to his compositions.\nAlong with his teacher Paniker, Vasudev was one of the founder-members of Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village, where he lived and worked till 1988. He has participated in several important group and solo exhibitions in India and abroad. A former member of the executive board of Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, the artist lives and works in Bengaluru.",

Later, on a French government scholarship, he went to study at \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he also trained with S. William Hayter and Krishna Reddy at Atelier 17.\nBetween 1950 and 1960, Das created thousands of drawings of horses. He spent hours at the stables of Calcutta\u2019s mounted police, studying horses and making sketches. While in Europe, Das visited Spain and after witnessing a series of bullfights, made several drawings and paintings of bulls. His flawless drawings capture the speed, power, and energy, of these equines and bovines, symbolic of the energy, aggression, and power, of modern times and of his own untamed youthful spirit and a sense of liberation.\nDas also created a series to represent the pressures women are subjected to, in an almost surreal manner. F. N. Souza once said about Das\u2019s work: \u2018His paintings are often about death and horror\u2026 [He is] a master of the horrific in art.\u2019 Experimenting with techniques, mediums, and styles, throughout his career, Das passed away in Kolkata on 10 August 2015.",

He painted pastoral and urban landscapes, intimate household scenes, social and religious functions, street scenes, and riversides, to much acclaim. Of special mention is Sen\u2019s large mural painted at Parliament House, New Delhi, depicting King Mahameghavahana Kharavela of Kalinga and his Jain council held at Udaygiri in the second century B.C.\nSen was associated with several art institutions in the country, among them Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan, and Calcutta University, as well as various government art galleries.\nHe also exhibited widely in the country and abroad, including Kabul, Afghanistan, and various cities in the U.S. Sen\u2019s work forms part of collections such as those of Academy of Fine Arts and Rabindra Bhavan, both in Kolkata.",

He also made works in burnt wood and machine-like steel elements. An important highlight was his design of the Belgian Embassy in New Delhi that was selected by the International Forum of Architects as one of the finest buildings of the twentieth century.  \nGujral received numerous awards including the Da Vinci award for lifetime achievement from Mexico, honors from the Lalit Kala Akademi, and the Padma Vibhushan from the Indian government.

    "bio": "A founding member of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, he was born in Baroda, Gujarat, on 10 November 1920. Bakre obtained a diploma in modelling and stone carving from Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, following which he was a pilot with the Air Force during the Second World War.\nIn 1947, along with his friend F. N. Souza, Bakre founded the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, which was joined by S. H. Raza, K. H. Ara, H. A. Gade, and M. F. Husain, as founder members.\nRudi von Leyden, a leading voice of the Indian art scene in the mid-twentieth century, introduced Bakre to the modernist movements of the U.S. and Europe, and helped mentor his ideology. Dissatisfied with the contemporary art scene in India at the time, Bakre left for London to pursue his career and earned international renown, both as a sculptor and painter.\nBakre potentialised the human form by transforming it through distortion, fragmentation, and partial elimination. His canvases were executed in a sculptural manner depicting geometrical grids and abstracted human forms in a two-dimensional pattern. The bold and bright colours highlighted the contrast of straight and curved lines.\nA much-feted artist, Bakre returned to India in the later years to lead a recluse\u2019s life. He passed away in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, on 18 December 2007.",

Bendre, completing his graduation (1950-56) and post diploma in Fine Art (1956-58).\nKnown for his paintings as well as large murals\u2014such as those that  adorned Air India\u2019s offices in London, New York, and Frankfurt\u2014his concerns were modernist, evident in the formal abstraction in his work, with a focus on the medium and its possibilities more than incorporating ideological narratives.\nLater, he consciously preferred printmaking, attracted as much to the medium\u2019s democratic nature for both the artist and the buyer, as also for the possibility of greater textures it offered.\nA co-founder of the Baroda Group in 1956 with fellow artists, Dave won the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi three years in a row, in 1956, \u201957 and \u201958. He was honoured with the Government of India\u2019s Padma Shri in 1985 and received the Sahitya Kala Parishad\u2019s award in 1986. The artist lives in New Delhi.",

He simultaneously started Sarada Ukil School of Art on Janpath, New Delhi, which continues to function as a training school for art teachers. His granddaughter, Rita Dey, shares family\u2019s stories of several rulers of principalities visiting the school for their portraits to be made by Ukil.\nAlso an actor, Ukil was cast as Gautam Buddha\u2019s father, King Shuddhodhana, in German director Franz Osten\u2019s 1925 silent film, Light of Asia. Ukil would go on to paint an entire series on the life of the Buddha, generally considered his masterpiece. However, only one original painting from the series, Buddha in Death Bed, survives, housed in the Salarjung Museum, Hyderabad; the rest survive only as photographs or post cards. His paintings were drawn from religious and mythological stories, executed in the soft hues of the wash technique.\nAlong with his brothers Barada and Ranada, Ukil founded the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society in New Delhi in 1928. Ukil passed away at the age of fifty-two on 21 July 1940 in New Delhi.",

In the 1990s, he produced a large body of oil paintings he termed \u2018corollary mythologies\u2019 which led to a series of hand-coloured etchings titled The Labyrinth of Eternal Delight. These works are elaborate pictorial fictions composed of elements drawn from Greek mythology and Indian iconography. Nair reinvents mythological allegories as contemporary tales, giving some of them creative and extended titles, and creates two parallel narratives\u2014visual and verbal/textual.\nIn 2000, Nair\u2019s work, An Actor Rehearsing the Interior Monologue of Icarus, depicting a naked Icarus placed on top of an Ashoka Pillar, was to be exhibited at National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, but courted controversy when it was subsequently rejected on grounds of being irreverent toward a national symbol, a rejection Nair contested as an artist with a right to respond to his environment with freedom.\nIn 2021, he was part of the exhibition, \u2018Narrating from the Museum Archives and Collection: 10 years of KNMA\u2019 to celebrate a decade of Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi, that turned ten in 2020.

    "bio": "His mirror throws not just a passive light on reality but also makes a critical, political comment on issues such as the relationship between the state and its subjects.\nFollowing his graduation from College of Art, New Delhi, in 1984, Ghosh went to Moscow to study at Surikov Institute of Fine Arts where he perfected the rendering of the human form. He returned to India in 1987 and joined the graphics studio at Garhi, New Delhi, and simultaneously completed his M.F.A. in painting in 1990 from College of Art. He also began working as a printmaker at Lalit Kala Akademi.\nIn 1994, Ghosh won the Commonwealth scholarship to study in the U.K., and proceeded to obtain a second MFA from Slade School of Fine Art, London, 1994-96, where he began experimenting with video. An inveterate learner, he undertook a course in 3-D animation in 2001 in New Delhi, and trained in puppet fabrication under Alain Duverne at Image et Mouvement, Paris, the following year.\nGhosh has participated in several group shows in national and international exhibitions. A recipient of a medal at the National Exhibition of Prints organised by Group 8 and the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1994, Ghosh lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "bio": "She was born on 18 June 1875 in the Tagore family of talented writers and painters\u2014Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore was an uncle, and Gaganendranath and Abanindranath Tagore were her elder brothers. Essentially a self-taught artist, she witnessed the Bengal renaissance, but it was only in her thirties that she began to paint, encouraged by her husband, the grandson of reformist Raja Ram Mohun Roy.\nSunayani Devi had an unerring instinct for line and form, movement and rhythm, and a vibrant imagination. Her works are striking for their simplicity and free flowing fine lines, highlighting the delicate features of the subject. Her colours are soft and vivid, with minimal details and ornamentation of subjects and setting. There is a vigour about her drawings and a nai\u0308ve simplicity of colour and composition that is reminiscent of the best of Indian miniature paintings. Stella Kramrisch, curator and educator, was in awe of her style.\nBeginning with 1908, her works were part of several exhibitions organised by Indian Society of Oriental Art in Calcutta, Allahabad, London, and many cities in the U.S.A. Her works were also exhibited at the 1922 Bauhaus exhibition in Calcutta. She passed away on 23 February 1962 in Calcutta.",

    "bio": "Picking herbs for his father every morning before going to school proved to be a lasting influence in Dakoji\u2019s life, making nature the leitmotif of his art.\nGrowing up in Hyderabad, he joined the city\u2019s Government College of Fine Arts and Architecture in 1959. In 1966, he joined M. S. University, Baroda, to learn printmaking. Interaction with teachers like K. G. Subramanyan and Jyoti Bhatt led to a deeper understanding of art, both as a craft and a way of life.\nPrimarily a printmaker, Dakoji\u2019s works are inspired by Indian culture in which nature and animals predominate. An early work, the Stone series, depicts primordial boulders dotting his hometown\u2019s landscape. On a trip to San Diego in 1985, the familiar call of the peacock turned into an epiphanic moment, revealing to him the primal connection of life across the globe. This led him to explore pranamu, or life force, in a series of etchings and lithographs, veering towards abstraction. On The LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) is another of his series, created over eight years on LIRR ticket stubs, when he used to transit between Manhattan and Babylon, New York.\nIn 1992, Dakoji learnt \u2018collaborative printmaking\u2019 at the Tamarind Institute, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, U.S.A., where the artist and the printer interact closely on the most appropriate means to heighten the work. Dakoji is based in New York.",

The artist also painted, with immense precision, the people of the land in their traditional attire. \nThe recipient of several important awards, medals, and prizes from prestigious art institutions and exhibitions, Joglekar was a watercolourist who painted sensitively, allowing the viewer to experience the remarkable stillness in his work. A promising student of Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, where he studied between 1912 and 1917, Joglekar received several scholarships from the British government, luminaries such as Lord Mayo, and the ruler of Kutch. From 1916-29, he participated in several painting competitions, winning numerous silver and bronze medals, including those from the Bombay Art Society. \nWorking mostly from Bombay, Joglekar travelled all over the country, often on invitation, to paint. In 1929, he was invited to paint panels depicting the history of the Maratha empire for the Lahore session of the Indian National Congress. A gifted watercolourist who often experimented in the wash technique, Joglekar was able to bring in the emotive essence of an Indian aesthetic into his painterly vocabulary along with a meditative, poetic vision. \nDespite being considered one of the great masters from the Bombay School, Joglekar\u2019s recognition came posthumously when his works were shown in prestigious exhibitions.\nThe recipient of several important awards, medals, and prizes from prestigious art institutions and exhibitions, Joglekar was a watercolourist who painted sensitively, allowing the viewer to experience the remarkable stillness in his work.

    "bio": "Roy Chowdhury learnt painting from Abanindranath Tagore, life drawing and portraiture from E. Boyess, and sculpting from Hiranmoy Roychoudhuri, with later training in Italy. Equally at ease with plaster and paint, Roy Chowdhury evolved his skills in bronze casting, and executed paintings that were an amalgam of the Chinese technique, the Japanese wash process, and his own scratching method, though his early paintings bore Tagore\u2019s influence.\nRoy Chowdhury joined the Madras College of Art as a student in 1928 and went on to become its principal. He chose his figures from the crowd in the streets in preference to studio models. His sculptures ranged from busts and life-sized statues to larger-than-life-size works. Among his notable public works are Dandi March in New Delhi; the bronze statue of Chithira Tirunal Balarama Varma, the last ruler of Travancore who in a historic proclamation, had opened Hindu temples to all castes and communities in 1936, in Thiruvananthapuram; Martyrs\u2019 Memorial in Patna; and the Triumph of Labour sculpture in Chennai.\nHe was honoured by the colonial government as the Most Exalted Member of the British Empire (M.B.E) in 1937. In 1958, the President of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan, and he received an honorary doctorate from Rabindra Bharati University in 1968. Chowdhury\u2019s works are included in major national and international collections. He passed away on 15 October 1975.",

    "bio": "Mistry is known to work across scale and mediums\u2014from large public works to more intimate sized pieces in clay, plaster, stone, steel, and fibreglass, among other mediums. Besides, he also explores drawing, painting, etching, drypoint, digital works and photography. \nBorn in Kanjari in Gujarat in 1957, Mistry obtained an M. A. in sculpture from M. S. University, Baroda, in 1981. Soon thereafter, he went to the Royal College of Art, London, on a British Council scholarship in 1983 to study sculpture. A truly global artist, his works speak to people of all geographies as he explores cultural tensions, drawing inspiration from a wide range of civilisations and cultures. \nMistry has held several shows at important venues around the world. He was an artist-in-residence at the Churchill College, Cambridge, in 1984-85; sculptor-in-residence at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, 1988; represented Britain at the Third Rodin Grand Prize Exhibition, Japan, in 1990; was elected a Royal Academician in 1991 and a fellow of the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1993; and received an honorary C.B.E. in 2001.\nIn 1992, the Birmingham City Council commissioned him to design sculptures for the city\u2019s Victoria Square.

    "name": "Dhanraj Bhagat",
    "year": "1917 - 1988",
    "intro": "Born in Lahore in British India, Dhanraj Bhagat acquired a diploma in sculpture from the city\u2019s Mayo College of Art.",
    "bio": "Bhagat began working with clay while studying but it left him uninspired as he found little individuality in its amorphous nature. It was when he got his hands on wood with its uniquely tactile qualities that he felt inspired to carve and create.\nBhagat\u2019s early wood sculptures bore liquid, stream-like forms of the sensual feminine, with smooth, elongated lines charged by lyricism and the sensitivity of a young man not yet traumatised by the horrors of Partition. Post the cataclysmic event, the artist\u2019s oeuvre started acquiring rough edges and un-smoothed chisel marks. Deeply moving, these works are charged with the intensity of Bhagat\u2019s experience as a Partition refugee.\nIn the 1950s, when Bhagat had settled in Delhi, he began experimenting with different mediums such as cement, papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9, aluminium, copper and brass, the inherent qualities of each suggesting to him new forms and contexts. His female figures became large and heavy, steeped in sorrow, far from the earlier, lyrical and smooth wooden ones.\nA series of mostly large, powerful sculptures executed in concrete marked his evolution towards abstraction. He won many accolades such as the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1961, the Sahitya Kala Parishad award in 1969, and the Padma Shri by the Indian government in 1977. He taught at the College of Art, New Delhi, from 1947-77, and breathed his last in 1988.",

    "bio": "He trained at Santiniketan, from where he received his diploma in fine arts in 1961. In his work, Dasgupta chose to be eclectic, perhaps more than his contemporaries.\nBy the late 1970s, he had evolved his hallmark style where the primary medium was a special egg tempera on canvas which he applied using a mouth spray for finish. His distinctive artistic style evolved during the \u201980s which he defined as a \u2018kind of satire, fantasy and humour mixed with folk art\u2019.\nDasgupta\u2019s painterly voyage was marked by an intimate understanding of human relationships, their pain and agony, joy and ecstasy, humour and wisdom. His art parodied the remnants of the babu culture, a legacy from the British Raj.\n As recurring motifs, a voluptuous woman, draped in a striped sari, at times counter-balanced with a man similarly clad in dhoti and kurta, appear in association with a flying tortoise, tiger, bird, flower or such objects as pots, vases or vintage cars, creating a very peculiar vision of human sensibility. The figures and objects appear to float in a mental space where the gravitational pull is decided by the artist. They float, glide and crouch, underlining the varied levels of psychic exegesis. \nIn 1981, Dasgupta was awarded by the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Calcutta. His works are held in several public and private collections in India and abroad.\nDasgupta\u2019s painterly voyage was marked by an intimate understanding of human relationships, their pain and agony, joy and ecstasy, humour and wisdom.

    "bio": "Khakhar began painting in the early 1960s after joining a course in art criticism at the Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, at the behest of the leading Baroda artist Gulammohamed Sheikh.\nKhakhar\u2019s creative endeavours also included writing short stories for Gujarati newspapers. In 1989,\u00a0Mojila Manilal, a play written and designed by Khakhar, was performed at Bombay, Baroda, and Ahmedabad. He also made a set of eight prints for a limited edition of two stories by Salman Rushdie,\u00a0Free Radio, and\u00a0The Prophet. Khakhar\u2019s own story,\u00a0Phoren Soap, was published with his original etchings in 1998.\nA self-taught painter, Khakhar was known for training his brush on everyday activity and life in middle class neighbourhoods. He made public his homosexual orientation in the 1980s, and gradually, this resulted in his exploration of issues of sexuality within the local Indian context. The narrative nature of his paintings brought to the fore a comic but gentle irony in communicating serious issues of sexuality, middle class morality, and censorship.\nRemembered as an iconoclast and a non-conformist, some of his seminal solo exhibitions include a retrospective at Museo Nacional, Centre de Art, Reina Sofia, in Madrid in 2002, and posthumous retrospectives at National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai, in 2003 and at Tate Modern, London, in 2016. Khakhar received the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 1984, and the Prince Claus Award from the Dutch government in 2000.",

    "bio": "His skill in painting earned him the nickname \u2018Painter\u2019. His excellence in traditional sculpture is evident in the large statue he made of Mahatma Gandhi, installed in Kolhapur.\nBaburao\u2019s colour schemes were influenced by the European classical style, lending an air of gentle charm to his works. Gifted but with no formal training, be it working on a lathe, painting, sculpting or designing costumes, the d\u00e9cor for a natak mandali or the drama stage, he excelled at them all and was considered a master artist. In fact, in the early years of the twentieth century, along with his cousin Anandarao, he was the leading painter of stage backdrops in western India, working for Gujarati-Parsi theatre groups.\nThe release of Dada Saheb Phalke\u2019s first film, Raja Harishchandra, in 1913, triggered his interest in films. His career in films started as an assistant to Phalke, and he went on to set up the Maharashtra Film Company in Kolhapur in 1919. He directed more than a dozen films and also acted in a few. It was during the shooting of Gad Aala Pan Sinha Gela, in which he played the role of Shivaji, that he fell off a horse and suffered an injury that tragically impaired his speech for life. He retired in 1946 to Kolhapur, living and painting there until his death on 16 January 1954.",

    "intro": "Born in a middle-class Bengali family on 21 June 1940, Bikash Bhattacharjee gathered his visual and intellectual ideals from the politically charged atmosphere of Calcutta during his growing up years.",
    "bio": "Like many of his contemporaries, he was sympathetic to the principles and cultural values of the Communist Party. But his highly individualised perception of the world differed from the imagery representing either political leaders or suffering people. His characters were more than just representative of their class; they were imprinted as individuals, each with a well-etched subjectivity.\nThe end of the 1960s up to the mid-\u201970s was marked by a series of surreal paintings with a subtext of the demonic or subhuman in a setting of either dark fantasy or farce. The\u00a0Doll series, conceived in 1971, was Bhattacharjee\u2019s emotional response to the violence that erupted across Calcutta at the time as a result of the Naxal movement. Here, Bhattacharjee came close to the abstract mode by portraying humans as dolls with erased eyes, wiping out any individuality. The allegoric vision of the subverted feminine in his portraits of prostitutes, middle-class women, or women with extreme sexual appeal\u2014rendered in photo-realist style\u2014was another prominent theme in his work.\nBhattacharjee was honoured by the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, in 1962, and received the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1971, the Bangla Ratna from the state government in 1987, and the Padma Shri from the Government of India in 1988.

    "bio": "A congenitally impaired vision that denied him normal schooling and resulted in a lonely childhood, brought him close to nature and had a deep impact on his art.\nMukherjee renounced the overt symbolism of mythology in favour of themes from everyday life. The expressionism of his early works may be compared with the work of the German expressionist group Die Br\u00fccke. A visit to Japan in 1936 proved particularly significant as he was an admirer of the Tosa School of Painting. \nExperimenting constantly in his drawings, sketches, woodcuts, dry-points and lithographs, he soon diversified to mural paintings. His perceptions of the Santiniketan landscape and campus life found artistic expression in several compositional calligraphic paintings. Mukherjee travelled widely, becoming for a brief while the curator of the Nepal Government Museum in Kathmandu, a period when he painted the Himalayan country in a series of drawings and watercolours.\nWhen Mukherjee completely lost his eyesight by the age of fifty, he began making drawings and small sculptures based upon figural images achieved by folding paper. He used writing as a tool to express his views on art. In 1973, Satyajit Ray made a documentary on him, The Inner Eye. Mukherjee received two literary awards, the Rabindra Puraskar and the Bhartiya Bhasha Parishad Award.

    "bio": "Later, De moved to New Delhi to teach at College of Art. Years spent in New York and extensive travelling over continents subsequently enriched his artistic expression with new forms.\r\nFrom 1956 onward, his figurative compositions began to fragment, turning into free shapes. Around this time, De, along with some of his contemporaries, drew away from the styles of their predecessors, urging the peer group to initiate an individual vantage based on inner experiences. De\u2019s imagery began evoking a metaphysical introspection through recurrent symbols of the lotus, the sun, the wheel, and bursting seeds. His paintings captured the implosion of energy devoid of any agitated movement, only a blinding effulgence at its heart. Experimenting with tantric art, he sought to express the physical union of man and woman through abstracted symbols: a \u2018u\u2019-like form representing the female principle and the straight and wedge-like shape representing the male.\nThe artist oscillated between deep blues and blazing reds, his final aim being the awakening of the psyche towards an undivided consciousness. Averse to the \u2018hard edge\u2019 abstraction of the West, De\u2019s fluid and suggestive geometry was about dispersion, diffusion and dematerialisation. His works\u00a0Apparition\u00a0and\u00a0Dying Ogre\u00a0won the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national awards. A Fulbright fellow, De painted many commissioned portraits.

The artist contributed articles and writings on Indian art in Yugoslavian publications during this phase of his scholarship. \nGoswami\u2019s art, given his early exposure to the Western masters, didn\u2019t appear strictly traditional even as it revealed subconscious traces of Kalighat pata-chitras in the stylisation of his voluminous figures, and even in the choice of themes. The artist\u2019s sculptures, particularly, gave a rich sense of experimentation. As an accomplished sculptor, known for his casting and patina skills, he was commissioned by the Indian government to restore and cast Ramkinkar Baij\u2019s outstanding Santhal Family in bronze in 1983. \nIn the early 1960s, after returning from overseas, Goswami joined the sculpture department of Indian College of Art and Draftsmanship, Calcutta. He continued working there for almost a decade, eventually becoming the principal of the college. In Santiniketan, Goswami taught in the department of sculpture between the mid-\u201980s and late-\u201990s.

His fascination for painting did not compete with his deep interest in English literature.\nA meeting in 1932 with Russian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich was a turning point in Sen\u2019s life. Inspired by Roerich, he began to paint Himalayan landscapes, but in a miniature format, marking a new era in Indian painting. Though compressed in a space only slightly larger than a matchbox, the landscapes do not create an impression of crowding.

    "bio": "Taking to art with natural ease, he began drawing as early as five years of age, making Ganesha and other popular Hindu deities on his slate using chalk. The inspiration sustained through his entire life, and his work was mainly inspired by Hindu mythology, philosophy, and ancient Indian art.\nVithal\u2019s works are based on aesthetic forms, structures, textures, colours, and compositions, always paying great attention to the demands of technique and craftsmanship and careful about his iconographic rendering. Vithal faced some financial hardship, a time when he worked as a signboard painter and designed\u00a0mandapas (canopies for weddings or large public festivals) and stages for events to earn a living. These introduced him to a diverse range of mediums and allowed him to understand the plasticity of a tangible medium.\nVithal also experimented with abstraction, retaining, however, the lyricism he felt was vital to a work of art. He worked with a range of mediums like graphite, chalk, watercolour, oil, stone, iron, bronze, aluminium, glass, as well as the new-age material of fibreglass. His focus shifted to sculpture in the mature phase of his career, finding the process of making a sculpture a greater tangible experience when compared to painting.\nHe built his career in Bombay, living with wife and artist B. Prabha, whom he had met while studying at Sir J. J. School of Art.",

After the war, he worked at Dhoomimal Art Gallery in New Delhi, and for advertising agencies. He eventually went on to teach at the College of Art, New Delhi, for fourteen years. A scholarship to study and travel in Europe for six months introduced him to gouache and oil as\u00a0mediums.\nNature was very important to Dasgupta and formed a seminal part of his practice. After an early reputation as a landscape painter, he briefly experimented with cubism after his tour across Europe, and later dabbled in neo-tantrism, marking his abstract phase. He eventually turned to pure abstraction, executed in watercolours and acrylic.\nBesides exhibiting widely in India and abroad, he also handled commissions for murals for the India pavilions at international trade fairs in Moscow, and Tokyo. Dasgupta was honoured by the Sahitya Kala Parishad, New Delhi, in 1972, and made a fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1989.

N. Narayanan Kutty. He joined the Kala Bhavana at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, in 1974, earning his bachelor\u2019s in 1979; he was awarded a national scholarship by the Government of India in 1978, while still a student. He also completed his masters from Santiniketan, in 1981.\nMentored by two prominent figures of modern Indian art\u2014Ramkinkar Baij and Sarbari Roy Choudhary\u2014 Radhakrishnan has experimented with a wide variety of materials such as molten bronze, beeswax, and plaster of paris, where the tactile, physical process of working with the material is as essential as the final work. Through his iconic bronze figures, he connects to the ordinary man\u2019s innermost quest for expressing himself or herself through the contours and figuration of the body.\nRadhakrishnan\u2019s accolades include an award for the best sculpture award in 1980 from Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Calcutta, and a research grant the following year from the Lalit Kala Akademi to work at Garhi Studios, New Delhi. \r\nSeveral of his sculptures are installed around the world\u2014 Cotignac (France), London, Denmark, and Chicago, and large works have been commissioned in Dehradun, Bikaner, New Delhi, Goa, Santiniketan, and, of course, in his native Kerala.

He next joined the Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, where he would teach over several years\u2014from 1951-59, and from 1961-80, with studying stints at Slade School of Fine Art, London, and as a John D. Rockefeller III Fund fellow in the U.S. in between. He also taught at Santiniketan from 1980-89.\nA contemporary of the Progressives, Subramanyan created a different kind of modern Indian art, drawing on myths, fables and traditional narratives in a variety of mediums\u2014from small-sized terracotta works to larger-than-life murals. He painted women, children, objects, and animals before a period of painting still-lifes exclusively in the 1960s, until the shift to the Terrace series in the \u201970s.\nKnown for the sensuality of his imagery and figures, the nightly backdrops and reflective faces, Subramanyan\u2019s paintings revealed a continued cubist influence. A major presence on the Indian art scene, he passed away on 29 June 2016 in Vadodara.",

A self-taught artist, Ara grew up in adverse conditions and was imprisoned for participating in Gandhi\u2019s Salt\u00a0Satyagraha movement. He evolved his trademark style\u2014especially his robust nudes and still-life paintings\u2014that is ineffably marked by a life-affirming zeitgeist.\nIn his art practice, Ara neither wished to shock with raw eroticism as Souza did, nor did he want to revisit folk art in the manner of Husain. He was a modernist for whom the form and language of art preceded all other social and political motivations. His art was always intuitive, imaginative, spontaneous and improvised and not deliberate or intellectual. This evolved a certain eclecticism which was neither imitative nor derivative but led him on an exploration of style on a kind of rambling journey.\nAra won several awards, beginning with the annual prizes of the Bombay Art Society, the Governor\u2019s Prize, and an award from U.N.E.S.C.O., all before Independence. He was the founder and secretary of the Artists\u2019 Aid Centre and trustee of the Jehangir Art Gallery, both in Bombay, and was both fellow and general council member of the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi.

    "year": "- 19th century",
    "intro": "The Kalighat temple came up in Calcutta in 1809, drawing communities of traditional artisans who began to produce pats or paintings on religious and mythological themes, sold to the pilgrims as souvenirs.",
    "bio": "Traditionally painted on cloth accompanied by vocal renditions of the illustrated, these pats were now produced by the largely anonymous pat makers, or patuas, on paper\u2014cheap and easily accessible\u2014in response to urban needs. They remained popular till the early decades of the twentieth century.\nBeginning with religious themes and featuring epics, they soon began to depict social themes, taking their cue from the Company Paintings, especially social satire that was famously captured in the series on the Elokeshi trial in Calcutta.\nThe popularity of Kalighat pats increased in mid-nineteenth century when the expanding railway network connected Calcutta to cities such as Varanasi, Patna, Bombay, and Agra, and even to suburbs and interiors of Bengal, leading to an increased inflow of tourists, traders, and pilgrims to Calcutta.\nBy the early twentieth century, Kalighat pats began losing ground to increasingly accessible print technology products, their impact on the developing art trends was tremendous. Many Indian artists trained in Western academism but looking to create an indigenous vocabulary, such as Jamini Roy, were inspired by Kalighat pats. These were also the inspiration behind Gaganendranath Tagore\u2019s caricatures lampooning the Westernised Bengali babu. An important collection of Kalighat pats is housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, gifted by the author Rudyard Kipling in August 1917.",

    "bio": "Goud followed it up with a post-diploma in mural painting and printmaking from Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda. The shift to Baroda made him sensitive to the uniqueness of his rural heritage. By the late 1960s, he had evolved a distinct style that reflected a pan-natural sexuality seen in terms of spontaneous, uninhibited passions, unfettered by the puritanical ethics of the urban middle class\u2014he was able to embed his childhood memories and rural vivacity within an urban framework.\nErotic indulgence highlighted by the intermingling of male and female, vegetal and animal forms, along with a direct rural simplicity, charged his works with palpable sensuousness. His later works, however, are more introspective, and are executed in softer forms and colours.\nA master draughtsman, Goud has excelled in a variety of mediums\u2014watercolour, gouache, dry pastels, clay, and metal. He has exhibited widely in India and abroad; notable exhibitions include solo shows in Mumbai and Delhi at various venues, and a retrospective in 2007 in New York. His work is part of prominent collections such as the Masanori Fukuoka and Glenbarra Art Museum, Japan, and The Phillips Collection, Washington, D. C. He won the Andhra Pradesh Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s award in 1962 and from 1966-71, among other honours from various institutions. He lives and works in Hyderabad.",

A chance encounter with painter and sculptor D. P. Roy Chowdhury convinced him to join the Government College of Art and Craft, Madras.\nRoy\u2019s works are distinct for his times as they followed neither the period\u2019s nationalist art, nor the academic realism taught at colonial art schools. He developed an eclectic personal style, experimenting with several mediums, and executed some large scale works, including murals. Upon returning to Medinipur after his studies, he was commissioned by the district magistrate to create murals for the local Vidyasagar Memorial.\nKnown for his depictions of popular mythological characters and episodes in a bright palette, Roy imparted a touch of delicate beauty and lyricism to his works. He primarily worked in watercolours.\nHis works began to appear in journals, and he opened an interior design firm, Roy Studio, on Dharamatala Street in Calcutta. Part of the active cultural scene of Calcutta, he was a member of Art Rebel Centre\u2014that he joined in 1933\u2014and various other short-lived artistic groups and societies that thrived in the eastern metropolis in the early years of the twentieth century before the Academy of Fine Arts was established in Calcutta.

His paintings reflected the style of his master Abandindranath Tagore; he carried Tagore\u2019s delicate, romantic style further by investing his figures with dresses and drapery that carried suggestions of the Ajanta frescos and Rajput paintings.\nIn 1912, along with Nandalal Bose, Majumdar took over the responsibilities of teaching at the Indian Society of Oriental Art and continued till 1930. Later, at Santiniketan too, he engaged himself with teaching the aesthetic principles inherited from his mentor.\nMajumdar\u2019s subject matter comprised mythological narratives, Puranic stories, and Vaishnav gods and saints. He charged his paintings with his own perception of\u00a0bhakti\u00a0(devotion) and aimed at a transcendental expression. One of the most significant Bengal School artists, Majumdar continued the trend of revivalism by evolving an art form rooted in traditional Indian modes of image-making and reflecting the spiritual world.\nAwarded an honorary D.Litt. by Rabindra Bharati University, Calcutta in 1963, the artist passed away in 1975.",

    "bio": "Born in a village in Belgaum in Karnataka in 1916, Kulkarni engaged with modernist techniques and mediums to create a highly individuated pictorial language.\nKulkarni imbued his figurative works with the classical grace of Ajanta paintings and a distinctive modernist spirit. If some works evoked village life and seemed to carry the melody of a flute being played in the distance, his cityscapes showed tightly packed blocks rising up in strong outlines. However, he neither idealised rural life nor disparaged urban existence\u2014choosing to paint life as he experienced it.\nOn completing his diploma from Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, Kulkarni shifted to Delhi in 1943 to work in textile design. Along with other artists who had moved from Lahore to Delhi following Partition, he became a member of the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, and was founder-president of Delhi Silpi Chakra. He was also a founder member of Triveni Kala Sangam, the multi-arts complex in New Delhi. From 1973-78, he served as the vice-chairman of Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi.\nKulkarni exhibited his works widely and travelled extensively, especially to South America, with Mayan and Etruscan art inspiring his visual language.

    "bio": "Winning a school competition led Roy to the Government School of Art, Calcutta, where he studied from 1931-37. Under Mukul Dey, he learnt to work in several mediums like watercolour, oil, charcoal, and crayon.\nIn 1939, he learnt landscape painting under J. P. Gangooly and was considered one of his last great students. Though he made works in other genres as well, it was his landscapes that lent him an enduring reputation. Roy\u2019s sublime renditions of natural vistas in oil, such as Darjeeling by Night, Light Awakening, Pleasure Boat, Blue Mountain, Kumaun Himalaya, among other works, stand out for the treatment of light and are a great balance between Bengal School and academic mannerisms. He travelled widely to paint en plein air. One of his most well-known paintings is that of the Howrah Bridge by night.\nRoy also painted murals for the Ramgarh Palace, in present-day Jharkhand. His portraits of contemporary luminaries such as Sir N. N. Sarkar, L. M. Sen, his teacher J. P. Gangooly, novelist Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, and others are well known. He exhibited widely in Calcutta, Delhi and Bombay.\nRoy taught at the Uttarpara Government High School in Calcutta and later joined his alma mater in 1950, where he taught for the next fifteen years, till his death at the age of fifty-four years.",

But he had been painting watercolours as early as 1922, and had begun showing regularly from 1928 at the all India exhibitions of the Madras Fine Arts Society.\nAs a teenager, Paniker watched D. P. Roy Chowdhury painting by the pavement before the Government College of Art and Craft on Poonamallee High Road, Madras. At the age of twenty-five in 1936, Paniker gave up his job to join the college, graduating with a diploma in 1940.\nSoon after his graduation, he was appointed a painting instructor at his alma mater, where he would later become the principal in 1957, a position he would hold for the next decade till his retirement. Drawn to the academic style in his early career, he renounced it in favour of indigenous styles and contexts to revolutionise painting methodologies in the art college, also setting up an artists\u2019 commune that continues to thrive in Chennai.

Later, he taught at Calcutta\u2019s Indian College of Arts and Draughtsmanship in the 1970s, and the Academy of Fine Arts in the \u201980s.\nOne of India\u2019s foremost surrealist painters who was influenced by artists such as Rabindranath Tagore, Marc Chagall, and Joan Mir\u00f3, Pyne famously said, \u2018I did not really know that I worked in the surrealist style till it was pointed out to me.\u2019 His works, spontaneous and individualistic, had surreal imagery in bold colours. A four-time winner of the award of the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, Pyne had represented India in the exhibition titled \u2018100 Years of Modern Indian Art\u2019 held at the Fukuoka Museum, Japan, in 1979.\nAn intensely private person, he preferred to pause, reflect and focus on painting while exploring a range of subjects\u2014myth, fables, human stories, culture, memories, fantasy, erotica\u2014in a vibrant palette. Art, for Pyne, was an intimate approach, thus requiring the artist to still the mind and experience the meditative aspect of creation.\nNothing stopped him, not even a paralytic stroke that affected the left side of his body in 1994. In fact, in the late \u201990s, Pyne painted his acclaimed nude series. He was painting till a year before his death, for as long as he could hold a brush, at his home in Kolkata.",

    "bio": "For Hebbar, Indian classical art remained a ceaseless source of inspiration, even though he was drawn to impressionism while studying at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, from 1934-38. His early paintings\u2014landscapes and figural compositions in the academic style\u2014disciplined his hand and mind and led him towards his own style.\nInspired by the Sri Lankan philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy\u2019s discourses, Hebbar began exploring his creativity through the traditional Indian art found in Jain manuscripts, Rajput and Mughal miniatures, and the Ajanta frescos, harmoniously blending it with surrealism and abstraction in his work. Strongly inspired by Amrita Sher-Gil\u2019s expression of the East through western techniques, Hebbar left for Europe in 1949 to explore western art further.\nThis exploration brought him to the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris where he studied under the impressionist painter Professor Cavailles, and later graphics at \u00c9cole Estienne. From 1964-75, he travelled across Europe, exhibiting his work. Upon his return, Hebbar experimented with mediums, methods and styles in order to find his own metre, even learning the classical dance form of Kathak to understand rhythm. Instinctively, he portrayed places and people as he saw them\u2014a developing India in which he witnessed both celebration as well as suffering.\nIn 1976, Hebbar was selected a fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi. From 1953-73, he served as the chairman of the Artist\u2019s Centre, Bombay, and received the Padma Bhushan from the Government of India in 1989. He passed away on 26 March 1996.",

Khanna briefly worked as a printer at Kapur Art Press, Lahore, before his family moved to Simla upon Partition. He worked at the Grindlays Bank in Bombay and Madras from 1946-61, subsequently resigning from his job to devote himself to art.\nIn Bombay, he became part of the extended Progressive Artists\u2019 Group. Largely self-taught, Khanna\u2019s art bears imprints of the traumatic experience of the socio-political chaos in the country in his youth. He first exhibited his works in 1949, when his first painting was bought by nuclear physicist Dr. Homi Bhabha, the founder director of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. In 1955, Khanna held his first solo show at U.S.I.S., Madras. His support for the marginalised and downtrodden shines through in his paintings depicting bandwallahs, dhabas, pavement fruit-sellers, and migrant labourers in trucks.\nIn 1962, Khanna became the first Indian artist to be awarded the Council on Economic and Cultural Affairs (later renamed the John D. Rockefeller III Fund) fellowship, and was artist-in-residence at the American University in Washington in 1963-64. In 1965, he received Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award.

    "bio": "Reddy's journey to that seminal moment in Paris was preceded by a stint at Santiniketan, studying under Nandalal Bose (1942-47), and then, as head of the art section at Kalakshetra, Madras (1947-50).\nReddy travelled to Europe with the support of philosopher J. Krishnamurthy, first studying at Slade School of Fine Art, London, and then training in sculpture with Henry Moore, Ossip Zadkine and Mario Marini. Interactions with Constantin Brancusi and Alberto Giacometti profoundly influenced his work.\nIn Paris, Belarusian-born French sculptor Zadkine introduced Reddy to S. W. Hayter, founder of the influential print studio, Atelier 17. It was here, in the early 1950s, that the most important developments in Reddy\u2019s career took place. Through his colour viscosity process, Reddy managed to attain a range of extraordinary colours on the plate, with each print becoming an individual coloured image. His abstract and semi-abstract prints revolved around the themes of nature and human figures. He also created sculptures in bronze, terracotta, stone, and marble.\nReddy became the first Indian to be appointed director of Atelier 17. Though not as feted in the country of his birth as internationally, Reddy was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1972. In 1976, he shifted to New York, where he passed away on 22 August 2018.",

    "bio": "Katt completed her bachelor\u2019s in fine arts from Banaras Hindu University and later completed her master\u2019s from the Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, in 1971. Interestingly, hers was the first art degree batch of the prestigious institution and she was the first female student to receive a gold medal in sculpture from the university. Later, in 1981, she received a research scholarship from the Slade School of Art, London.\nGreatly inspired by Auguste Rodin, Katt has even studied corpses closely in pursuit of her art. Her artistic process involves understanding the \u2018being\u2019 behind the face. Her sitters have included some of the very well-known artists of Indian modern art such as Ramkinkar Baij and N. S. Bendre, among others.\nIt was in the 1970s that Katt started gaining recognition for experimenting with economically viable materials such as cow dung and paper to create works of art. Her choice of materials has included stone and marble with which she has completed prestigious commissions. She became recognised too for making iconic sculptures of prominent statespersons.\nKatt has received many honours, including the national award from the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi. More recently, she won the Beijing Art Biennale Award for her bronze work titled Makar Sankranti at Dashawmeth Ghat, Varanasi. She taught in the fine arts department of Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, and continues to divide her time between Delhi and Banaras.",

    "name": "L. N. Taskar",
    "year": "1870 - 1937",
    "intro": "Laxman Narain Taskar\u2019s paintings mirror the ideals of academic realism introduced by the British within their art education system.",
    "bio": "Indian artists were trained in naturalism, with lessons in soft effects of chiaroscuro and the three-dimensionality of the external world. History painting, perspective, and the copying of Victorian portraits became a vital ingredient within these art schools.\nIn 1898, Taskar joined Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, as a teacher. Adopting the style of objective accuracy, formal order and an interest in visual narration, his paintings concentrated on \u2018slices of everyday life\u2019. They became a tool for reflecting upon contemporary reality, where he replaced mythological figures with common people in their local environments.\nThrough vibrant colours, he lucidly portrayed moods of festivities, and local people engaged in rituals and routines. Women were often depicted in familial or community settings, and rarely as private beings. In defiance of the academic norms of the time, Taskar became one of the few artists to paint subjects such as courtesans, as opposed to the usually passive portrayals required of commissioned portraits.\nTaskar made several departures from his rigid academic training in the transparent watercolour technique. Sometimes, his oils adopted the lightness and airiness of his watercolours. The visibility of the pencil drawing underneath enhanced the formal construction of the work, energising the outdoor atmosphere with a soothing lightness. Taskar\u2019s works are part of several collections, the most prominent being that of Sir Ganga Singhji Bahadur, the maharaja of Bikaner.",

    "bio": "Despite training in Company School art, traditional Kalighat pats and Ajanta cave frescos, Shaw evolved his distinctive style to work in watercolours and oil. His teachers were some of the leading artists of the time, such as Gopal Ghose, Rathin Maitra, and Maniklal Banerjee.\nIn the 1970s, Shaw mastered the genre of graphics\u2014initiated by the Society of Contemporary Artists\u2014expressing it through the abstract form. Shaw experimented with the two-dimensional, geometric and non-figurative, as is evident in his lithographs.\nUnlike his prints, Shaw\u2019s paintings are charged with nostalgia and are object-specific. His brooding characters\u2014men, women, and children\u2014seem frozen into a kind of quiescent gesture; they are formal and speechless, but still expressive. Drawing from Mughal miniatures and adhering largely to profiles framed within borders along the edges, Shaw depicts faces of ordinary people, emphasising their physical characteristics. He has also experimented with landscapes, appearing to merge the urban and rural visual in styles ranging from the minimalist to cubist-inspired. His confident use of broad blocks of colours placed harmoniously is seen here too.\nShaw has exhibited extensively in India and abroad and his works form part of national and international collections. He has received prestigious awards like the West Bengal Lalit Kala Akademi award, the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi, and the Birla Academy award. He lives and works in Kolkata.",

    "bio": "Born in Margao, Goa, on 21 January 1926, Pai participated in Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s Satyagraha movement against the British rule that led to his imprisonment. Later, he participated in the movement to liberate Goa from centuries of Portuguese rule.\nYet, it was not the political climate of his youth but Goa that remained a source of inspiration for him. A contemporary of the other renowned artist from Goa\u2014F. N. Souza\u2014Pai gave expression to life\u2019s experiences in his canvases with vigour and a richness of colour, but devoid of any commentary or moralistic narrative.\nHe called himself his own guru, creating a highly individual vocabulary, which was accentuated during his ten-year stay in Paris. Influenced by the works of Paul Klee, Mark Chagall, and Joan Mir\u00f3, Pai created an eclectic intermingling of the traditional and the modern in his work. He explored the stylisation of Indian folk art with modern techniques such as angular simplification and flatness of the pictorial surface.\nUpon his return from Paris, Pai served as the principal of the Goa College of Art (1977-87). He won many prestigious honours, such as the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi in 1961 and 1963; Gomant Vibhushan Award, the highest civilian award of the Goa government; and the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan from the government of India, among others. He passed away in Dona Paula, Goa, on 14 March 2021.",

    "intro": "A dynamic artist, intellectual, and educator, L. Munuswamy was a prominent practitioner within the Madras Art Movement who made abstraction a personal language in his artistic vocabulary.",
    "bio": "What made Munuswamy's works appealing was their international character, his individualistic vision and single-minded pursuit in his artistic endeavours. Regarded as innovative and experimental, the introvert artist had a highly representative career, particularly when seen in the context of India in the 1950s.\nIt was a decade when abstraction was seen as a movement, when the post-Independence milieu was marked by economic and cultural progress, growth of patronage from commercial houses, galleries, institutions, collectors, and foreign visitors.\nBelonging to a family of idol-makers, Munuswamy joined Government School of Art and Craft, Madras, on the insistence of his grandfather in 1956, graduating with a diploma in painting in 1961. He joined the faculty as a teacher\u2014later appointed its principal\u2014in 1971, retiring from the post in 1986. As a student, Munuswamy was mentored by three distinctive personalities\u2014D. P. Roy Chowdhury, S. Dhanapal and K. C. S. Paniker\u2014all of whom impacted his art profoundly.\nHis engagement with line, colour and space led him to consciously choose the language of abstraction, indirectly allowing the regional character a meaningful role. Setting his gaze on the human form to mediate his abstract expressions, Munuswamy\u2019s artistic language remains unparalleled.",

    "bio": "Born into a family of painters in Kolhapur, Mali studied art professionally at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, in the 1920s. It was here that he grasped the nuances of painting through academic realism. Working mostly in the medium of watercolour and oil, Mali keenly observed how some of his teachers, including Walter Langhammer, worked with various tools and applied bold brushstrokes with knife.\nRegarded as one of the highest paid portrait painters of his time, he was renowned for his art and commissioned by many industrialists, statespersons, and other known personalities. What made his portraits stand out was the uniqueness in studying his subjects closely and having the ability to capture every detail on the canvas. Besides these commissions, Mali often projected common people\u2014sadhus, roadside vendors, street musicians, and artistes\u2014in his work, compelling viewers to become a part of their lives.\nAn active member of Art Society of India, he was friends with artists such as N. S. Bendre, S. L. Haldankar, V. P. Karmakar, among others. Winning several accolades during his lifetime, Mali was conferred Roopdhara\u2014\u2018lifetime achievement award\u2019\u2014by Bombay Art Society in 2005. The centenarian\u2019s work has been part of collections of prestigious museums, including Victoria Memorial, Kolkata, Baroda Museum, and India House, London.",

The abstract derivations with ritual connotations in the artist\u2019s early paintings gradually evolved into an iconic figure of an elongated human form, mostly female, who dwelt in the intermediate space between the earth and the skies. His art addresses human and environmental concerns, issues of mass consumerism, and cultural globalisation. At the same time, his engagement with man\u2019s quest for immortality sweeps away cultural dimensions of the sacred and the profane, the local and the global.\nNayar won the 1981 Lalit Kala Akademi national award for his sculpture Mankind-2101. In 1988, he designed the citation trophy for the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding.\nNayar lives and works in New Delhi with his artist wife, Gogi Saroj Pal.",

    "bio": "He received his diploma in painting from Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, in 1948. Impressed by his work, the members of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group\u2014formed in 1947\u2014pulled him into their meetings. The strength of his talent was soon recognised elsewhere\u2014he won the first prize of the Young Asian Artists Association in Tokyo in 1957, and a John D. Rockefeller III Fund fellowship in 1964.\nThe textural structure with the interplay of colour is the central conductive device in Gaitonde\u2019s paintings. His compositions, inspired by Zen philosophy, possess a kinetic power that imparts movement to his delicately balanced configurations. For Gaitonde, art began in an intensity that moved steadily towards refining itself, even as it explored the artist\u2019s inward spaces and momentary realities. Gaitonde used a roller and a palette knife to influence and mix different mediums on canvas.\nThough Gaitonde was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1971, his real success came after his death. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York organised a large exhibition of his works posthumously in 2014-15, while the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Mumbai, organised another one in 2019. He was among the first Indian modernists whose works created high value at auctions; they continue to enjoy that position. Gaitonde passed away on 10 August 2001 in New Delhi.",

Paniker, and along with him became a founding member of the Cholamandal Artists\u2019 Village.\nIn 1967, Viswanadhan participated in Biennale de Paris, and settled in the city the following year. By then, he had already formulated his concept of space, tantric mandalas, and geometric forms, but in time arrived at a new synthesis, narrowing the existing polarities between the East and the West. Though his use of colour remained bold and warm as before, he re-examined his interpretation of space after coming in contact with contemporary Western art\u2014freeing space from the esoteric notions of geometrical figurations, he began to interpret space as time.\nViswanadhan\u2019s engagement with various mediums is blended with his understanding of light and colour, one he has explored in his films as well. Saturated with reds and greens, mauves and crimsons, his works evoke memories inextricably linked with a life lived in different geographical spaces.\nInspired by music, Viswanadhan admits that for him drawings are like liberated sound: \u2018When they are earthbound, they are like drums. The saxophone and flute are air-bound.\u2019 Widely exhibited and collected across Europe, Viswanadhan lives and works in Paris and maintains his studio in Cholamandal.",

    "intro": "Vasudha Thozhur is known for her conscious art practice that seeks to give expression to conflicts which humans encounter daily in a tension-ridden contemporary society.",
    "bio": "Born in Mysore on 14 October 1956, Thozhur received a diploma in painting from the College of Art and Craft, Madras, in 1972. She received a post diploma in painting from Croydon School of Art and Design, U.K., in 1982.\nPrimarily a painter, Thozhur creates works across mediums, comprising drawing, video, digital prints, and spoken and written text. Her works are bold, not just in content but also in colours as stark reds are juxtaposed against cavernous blacks, neon yellows and psychedelic greens. At the same time, some works convey her message in black-and-white.\nConstantly seeking to respond to her social environment, Thozhur collaborated with Himmat, an organisation based in Ahmedabad, where she worked with girls who had lost family members in the 2002 Gujarat riots. She taught them painting, silkscreen printing, photography, video, embroidery, appliqu\u00e9, and batik, and created an exhibition featuring their work along with her own charged paintings that was displayed in 2013.\nThozhur\u2019s work has been shown at exhibitions at important venues such as Chicago Cultural Centre, Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland, World Social Forum in Nairobi, Museo Tamayo in Mexico City, and Asia Society and Queens Museum of Art in New York, among other places. She is currently a professor at Shiv Nadar University, Noida.",

    "bio": "His artistic talent was discovered early, and he went to Kyoto to study painting, eventually moving to Tokyo to study under Shotaro Koyama. He studied Western-style painting and embarked on travels abroad, achieving great success selling his watercolours and oil paintings in the United States, Europe and North Africa. \n It was not before 1920 that Yoshida began creating woodblock prints, apparently inspired by the West\u2019s fascination with ukiyo-e or Japanese woodblock prints. He was supported by Watanabe Shozaburo, publisher and owner of the Watanabe print store in Tokyo, who published the first seven of Yoshida\u2019s woodblock prints. In 1923, Watanabe\u2019s store was gutted by the fires resulting from the Great Kanto earthquake, destroying Yoshida\u2019s wood blocks and more than a hundred prints. \n Yoshida belonged to the Shin-Hanga (\u2018New Print\u2019) movement of printmaking, that integrated Western elements without giving up the values of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, taking ukiyo-e to new heights. Artists were able to lend the effects of light and individual moods with the new syncretic movement. Yoshida\u2019s prints reflected his love for travel and mountains. He spent four months from November 1930 travelling in India and Southeast Asia. Over the next two years, he produced a series of thirty-two woodblock prints of scenes from this trip. He was particularly fascinated with the quality of light he found in India and often depicted the same subjects at different times of day or night.",

He would shift continents\u2014living and tasting success in London in the 1950s and \u201960s\u2014before settling in New York.\nSouza found his own blunt, extreme style by combining the expressionism of Rouault and Soutine with the spirit of cubism and the sculptures of classical Indian tradition. He combined fierce lines with cruel humour. Nudes, landscapes, and portraits\u2014he painted in every style and in every medium, even inventing \u2018chemical alterations\u2019, a method of drawing with the use of chemical solvent on a printed page without destroying the glossy surface.

He commenced by painting for the theatres, accepting small commissions, and sketching the islands of Andaman and Nicobar for the Surveyor-General of India, Alexander Kyd.\nEncouraged by the Orientalist Sir William Jones, and British interest in the lifestyles of the Indians, Solvyns decided to produce a comprehensive record of Indian festivals, occupations, castes, musical instruments, asceticism, and transport. After limited printing in 1796, he published in 1799 A Collection of Two Hundred and Fifty Coloured Etchings, Descriptive of the Manners, Customs and Dress of the Hindoos, in Calcutta. Living in Paris from 1803 to 1814, Solvyns redid the etchings and published two hundred and eighty-eight plates in four volumes, titled Les Hindo\u00fbs.\nThese first-ever etchings are the earliest ethnographic survey of the people and their life in Bengal, encyclopaedic in nature and prototypes of the Company School of painting. Compelling, the figures are individual in character, an ordered portrayal of the Hindu caste division prevalent in society two hundred years ago. In that sense, Solvyns\u2019s work becomes even more significant today from a historical and social perspective of India.\nHe returned to Antwerp from Paris in 1814, where he passed away on 10 October 1824.",

    "bio": "She was ten at the time of the Partition and the consequent events impacted her life and her art forever, especially since her family chose to migrate to Pakistan some years later.\nZarina graduated in mathematics from AMU in 1958 and soon married Indian Foreign Service officer Saad Hashmi at the age of twenty-one. Travelling the world with her husband, the peripatetic nature of her new life came to be the second biggest denominator of her art following the Partition, both informing her lifelong quest for home, a recurrent theme in her works.\nWhile on a Paris posting, she studied printmaking under S. W. Hayter at Atelier 17, from 1963-67, and in 1974 she joined the Toshi Yoshido Studio in Tokyo to study woodblock printing. In 1977, when based in New York, her husband passed away and Hashmi decided to make the city her home for the rest of her life.\nEngaging herself in the politics of space, the artist questioned identity, the meaning of home, the urge for roots, borders and memory. In a series of works titled Maps, Homes and Itineraries, Mapping a Life and House with Four Walls, she challenged the actual space of cities by reconstructing the real maps in her minimalistic prints as fractured diagrams and angular lines, breaking through their borders. She taught printmaking at Bennington College, Cornell University, and at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \r\nBased in New York for most of her working life, she passed away in London on 25 April 2020.",

He is also a photographer and has worked with digital and computer imagery. The memory of the first sight of the earth from above, while on a flight, appears frequently in the form of maps, grids, and aerial terrain. Another important trope in his works has been imagery associated with the flying machine, inspired by his fascination with Second World War cinema.\nPalaniappan was an advisor to Bharat Bhavan, Bhopal, in 1990-92 and 1994-98. In 1992, he visited France on a French government grant, and in 1993 studied advanced lithography at Tamarind Institute, University of New Mexico, and Art Academy of Cincinnati in Ohio, both in the U.S., on a Fulbright grant. In 1996, he was an artist-in-residence at Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, Oxford University, U.K., on a grant from the Charles Wallace Trust. In 1997, he was appointed regional secretary, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, and curated its exhibition, \u2018Major Trends in Indian Art\u2019, marking the fiftieth anniversary of India\u2019s independence.

    "bio": "A graduate of Delhi College of Art, he has been an art teacher throughout his career. He was a lecturer at his alma mater before moving to Jamia Millia Islamia University and then Sarda Ukil College, eventually taking over as head of department at Triveni Kala Sangam, a position he has held since 1984.\nStarting as a representational painter, Broota dabbled in abstraction before returning to the figurative style. His visual language bears elements of realism and expressionism.Allegorical, grotesque, satiric representations manifested in his Ape series of the 1970s in which he critiqued the corruption and decadence among the elite. Later, Broota moved to the realm of the timeless, exploring the opposing pulls of matter and spirit.\nThe leitmotif of Broota\u2019s imagery in his series\u00a0Man,\u00a0Faces\u00a0and Scripted in Time is the \u2018man\u2019\u00a0who, collectively, represents mankind. His paintings of the male nude have arisen from the suggestion of strength and force as symbolised by the masculine torso. Browns, greys, blues, whites, and metallic tones of gold, silver, and copper, dominate these works.\nIn the \u201970s, Broota invented his scratching technique involving scratching through layers of paint with blades. The result is a powerful depiction of sometimes inimical forces\u2014the human body juxtaposed against architecture, for instance\u2014that have marked him as a painter of major significance. His experimentation with cinematographic language resulted in video art films in the mid-\u201980s, and his recent interest in photography has been critically acclaimed. The artist lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "bio": "Born in 1936 in New Delhi, he studied at the Polytechnic (later renamed College of Art) from 1953-58, and at Belgrade in erstwhile Yugoslavia from 1960-62. While in New Delhi, he became a founding member of the group called The Unknown that survived from 1960-64.\nDhawan participated in many shows following his return from Belgrade and also taught art at a college in Phagwara, Punjab. However, he left for Paris in 1970 to study at \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, eventually settling down in the French capital. Thereafter, he made infrequent visits to New Delhi for a few exhibitions. In Paris, the reclusive Dhawan was described by his peers as a \u2018painter\u2019s painter\u2019 and comparisons were made of his work with those of V. S. Gaitonde and J. Swaminathan.\nTwo other prominent Indian abstractionists were Dhawan\u2019s contemporaries in Paris \u2014 S. H. Raza and V. Viswanadhan\u2014but unlike them, Dhawan did not claim an indigenist abstraction, simply letting his art be for its own sake.\nThe metaphysical nature of Dhawan\u2019s work stayed constant throughout his career. Looking back at a lifetime of work, in 2011, a year before he passed away, Dhawan observed in an exhibition catalogue: \u2018My works have evolved as I have with time. I paint today as I did years ago, but when I sometimes look back, I see that change. It was a subtle, slow change.\u2019",

    "intro": "While R. N. Pasricha's early works and sketches are distinctly academic, the gradual flow of abstraction into his works is discernible; the impulse towards abstraction comes through in his cubistically painted houses in several landscapes.",
    "bio": "Born in Amritsar on 17 November 1926, he grew up in Delhi. Graduating in science, he worked as a typist to earn his livelihood. But, it was painting that drew him\u2014a passion since childhood\u2014 and he enrolled for night classes in art. He honed his skills in painting under the guidance of artist Abani Sen.\nPasricha\u2019s early works mostly consist of sketches done in sensitive black lines but he found his mojo as a landscapist. He was inspired by the works of Nicholas Roerich and his preferred medium was watercolour. Pasricha balanced his watercolours using various warm and cool tones to delineate individual objects. He painted several landscapes in and around Delhi, but it was the Himalayan ranges that became his muse for over fifty years. Many of his trips involved arduous trekking as well.\nPasricha received mention in the Limca Book of Records, 1997 and 1998, for being the only artist to have climbed as high as Kamet (7,620 m) and Mana (4,207 m) peaks of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand and painted them en plein air. The records also noted his painting of sixty-five Himalayan peaks. \r\nHe passed away on 11 January 2002. Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, bestowed him with its Kala Vibhushan award posthumously in 2006.\nHe passed away on 11 January 2002.

    "bio": "Born in Baler in Rajasthan\u2019s Sawai Madhopur district in 1905, he developed a keen interest in painting at an early age, initiated by a wandering sadhu of the Ram Snehi sect. He joined Maharaja School of Art and Craft in Jaipur, where Asit Kumar Haldar was principal.\nVijaivargiya later studied watercolour wash under Shailendra Nath Dey, a disciple of Abanindranath Tagore. Both Haldar and Dey were proponents of the Bengal School, which had a profound influence on Vijaivargiya\u2019s work. He drew inspiration from the plays of the classical Sanskrit playwright from the fourth-fifth century CE, Kalidasa, Hindu epics, the medieval poet Bihari\u2019s,\u00a0and\u00a0the Persian poetry of Omar Khayyam, Sadi, and Hafiz.\nPersonal discovery of traditional Rajasthani paintings led to the second genre of work that Vijaivargiya created\u2014vignettes of vividly-coloured Rajasthani life, linear studies of rustic simplicity of work and play, and the whirl of fairs and festivals. Gaining considerable recognition for his paintings by the time he was thirty, his paintings were frequently reproduced in Modern Review\u00a0and\u00a0Amrit Bazar Patrika, Bengali magazines Prabasi\u00a0and\u00a0Basumati, and several Gujarati and Hindi magazines. Vijaivargiya headed Rajasthan Kala Mandir and Rajasthan School of Art from 1945-66. In 1984, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India.",

    "name": "Ranbir Singh Kaleka",
    "year": "b - 1953",
    "intro": "Often erotic and libidinous, Ranbir Kaleka's works present themselves to the viewer, who might project their sub-conscience, in a way that already accounts for subverting any possibility of ambiguity on a subjective level.",
    "bio": "Born in Patiala, Punjab, in 1953, Ranbir Kaleka earned a diploma in painting from Punjab University\u2019s College of Art in Chandigarh. He spent the next few years teaching at Punjab University and College of Art, New Delhi, before leaving for London on a Charles Wallace scholarship to study at Royal College of Art from 1985-87. He stayed on in London for several years and returned to India in the late 1990s.\nOften termed surrealistic, Kaleka\u2019s works usually follow a dream-logic, refraining from coherent narratives. Though his earlier works from the \u201970s seemed more internalised, weaving together apparently unrelated, fantastic elements, his later works remain open ended and in communication with the viewer, making their viewing an interactive experience. The libidinal element in his works remains masculine and primal, framed by phantasmal animal motifs.\nIn the later years, Kaleka found expression in video art, projecting video onto painted canvases. Here, too, the works attempt to draw the viewer into the narrative, such as in Powder Room (1999-2000), which uses a reflective surface. His video work,\u00a0Man with Cockerel,\u00a0was chosen for the group show \u2018Indian Narrative in the 21st Century: Between Memory and History\u2019, at Casa Asia, Madrid and Barcelona, Spain, presented in collaboration with the Walsh Gallery. The artist lives and works in New Delhi.",

Landscapes and his observations of common people were his frequent subjects.",
    "bio": "Born in 1902 in Tripura, he went to the Government College of Art in Calcutta in 1919 but left it in 1921 to join the newly founded Kala Bhavana at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. Soon after graduation, he began his teaching career, first at Kalashala at Andhra National Art Gallery in Machilipatnam, and then at Kala Bhavana. He then joined Government School of Art, Calcutta, as a teacher in 1929, when Mukul Dey, the pioneer of dry point etching in India, was its principal. In 1943-46, Chakravorty was the school\u2019s officiating principal when he set up its graphics department. Eventually, he became the school principal in 1949.\nIn between, Chakravorty went to Slade School of Art, London, in 1937, to study painting, and also trained in wood engraving under Eric Gill. During this period, he also travelled widely around Europe and brought out important publications of his work, including the seminal Sketches of Europe before the War, published in London in 1944. Only a few copies of this compilation survive, and most are held in the permanent collections of American universities.\nIt is widely believed that his untimely death at the age of fifty-three prevented his art from reaching the pinnacle it deserved.",

    "bio": "Rodwittiya studied for her bachelor\u2019s degree in fine arts at from the Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, from 1976-81. She simultaneously studied and practised photography under the guidance of eminent Baroda-based artist Jyoti Bhatt. Soon after, she received an Inlaks scholarship to study for her master\u2019s in painting at Royal College of Art, London (1982-84). In the meantime, she also studied film and video at London\u2019s Fulham Institute.\nWorking across mediums, Rodwittiya has created allegorical works that are like psychological dialogues on socio-political issues, concerning topics such as alienation, belonging, acceptance, as also experiences of being a woman in contemporary society. All of this is deciphered through her accumulated observations of the past tempered with her beliefs and values. Her protagonist has often been a woman who is depicted absorbed in her daily routine. Rodwittiya\u2019s colour palette is bright and cheerful and she uses symbols and motifs metaphorically.\nA multi-faceted artist, Rodwittiya exhibits her works regularly in exhibitions in India and abroad, apart from delivering lectures and conducting workshops on Indian art at prestigious international shows. In 1990, she was awarded the fellowship of the Rockefeller Foundation-Asian Cultural Council to work in the U.S. She lives and works in Baroda.",

    "year": "1929 - 2019",
    "intro": "Rabin Mondal was inspired by primitive and tribal art, its potent simplifications and raw energy.",
    "bio": "The son of a mechanical draughtsman, Rabin Mondal took to drawing and painting at the age of twelve when he injured his knee and was confined to bed.\nThe Bengal famine of 1943 and the Calcutta communal riots of 1946 deeply impacted his psyche; he joined the Communist Party and became an activist. Mondal\u2019s final refuge was art as the ultimate weapon of protest.\nMondal\u2019s figuration derived from a growing abhorrence towards mankind\u2019s moral decay in all spheres of life. The cubo-futuristic angularities of forms within the pictorial space arranged around them evolved into a series of paintings depicting highly distinct human figures that struggled to live a hero\u2019s life in a mocking but tragic world.\nMondal\u2019s images have a deeply felt iconic appearance. The series\u00a0Queen, King, Man\u00a0represent figures that are static, totemic, tragicomic, ruthlessly shattered and ruined. Having subverted the classical canons of harmony and beauty, Mondal evolved a vocabulary to express his anguish and rage towards decadence in society. The expressionistic use of splattered colours and the bold application of black are part of that vocabulary.\nBeginning his career as an art teacher, with a stint as an art director in films, he was a founder member of Calcutta Painters in 1964, and from 1979-83 a general council member of Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi. He passed away in Kolkata on 2 July 2019.",

    "bio": "His paintings, with their intense, semi-expressionist faces of men and women inhabiting a twilight world and a nebulous dreamscape, conveying suppressed emotions and a deep, brooding interiority, had no national connection but belonged to the modern international diction of painting.\nTagore\u2019s paintings represented a break with himself as a poet and philosopher. His belief in harmony, ultimate goodness and beauty of mankind and the world, appeared in direct dissonance with the subject of his paintings, with the latter subverting the former.\nTagore\u2019s first exhibitions were in Paris, and successful, but were less well received in India at the time. Tagore, who set up Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, was instrumental in establishing Kala Bhavana, its art department, with Nandalal Bose as its head. His works were declared a National Treasure under the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act, 1972. Tagore passed away on 7 August 1941 in Calcutta.",

    "bio": "Born in Simla on 23 September 1924, Ram Kumar studied for his master\u2019s in economics at St. Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi University. While at college, Kumar attended evening classes at Sarada Ukil School of Art, where he learnt the \u2018Western style\u2019 of painting under Sailoz Mookherjea.\nHis unpeopled, abstract landscapes are devoid of the usual constituents of reality, only suggesting land, trees, sky, and water, through the intensity of colours.\nLike several first-generation, post-colonial Indian artists, such as F. N. Souza, S. H. Raza, Akbar Padamsee, and Paritosh Sen, Ram Kumar combined a desire for global success with the need to belong emphatically to his homeland. In 1950, he left for Paris to study under Andr\u00e9 Lhote and Fernand L\u00e9ger, where he became part of the communist circle of intelligentsia, attending meetings and demonstrations. Upon his return to India, he regularly exhibited with Delhi Silpi Chakra, becoming by the mid-1950s one of India\u2019s emerging young painters. He received the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1956 and 1958, and the Government of India\u2019s Padma Shri in 1971. In addition to being a visual artist of repute, Kumar was also a prolific writer in Hindi.\nOne of India\u2019s foremost modernists, Kumar passed away on 14 April 2018.",

    "intro": "Born on 25 May 1906 in Bankura in Bengal, Ramkinkar Baij was an iconoclast who defied the artistic norms of Santiniketan, where he had enrolled on the advice of journalist Ramananda Chatterjee.",
    "bio": "One of the pioneers of modern Indian sculpture, Baij created art spontaneously, driven by intuition and energy and disregarding the artistic standards accepted by the institution.\nA brief introduction to modelling by a visiting French sculptor led Baij to engage with clay in a unique manner and evolve a personal, innovative style that was largely untrained. He introduced cement concrete casting as an alternative to expensive plaster. The first artist in Santiniketan to use oil paint and create distinctly modern and abstract works, Baij painted on Santhal wraps with packet colours thinned with linseed oil and drew his figures on silk with a shoe brush as part of his innovations.\nDrawn from life, Baij\u2019s figures breathed a bold realism, an earthy strength and spontaneity seen in his sculptures, drawings, and paintings. A similar spontaneity of action is visible in his transparent watercolours and drawings, particularly in the sequence of nudes. The country\u2019s first truly \u2018modern\u2019 sculptor, Baij\u2019s sculptures were often monumental and possessed an inner movement, as seen in the Santhal Family or Mill Call, two of his best-known open-air sculptures in Santiniketan.\nThe colossal\u00a0Yaksha and Yakshi\u00a0sculptures at the Reserve Bank of India, New Delhi, brought Baij recognition, even though they differed in style from his other work. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India in 1970.",

    "bio": "Born in 1910 in Pabna, in present-day Bangladesh, he graduated from College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, in traditional Indian art, oil painting, and Western academism. Abanindranath Tagore, Mukul Dey and other Bengal masters were major influences but Bagchi evolved his own artistic style. In 1951, he joined Kala Bhavana, Santiniketan, as teacher, officiating twice as its principal in subsequent years.\nKnown for his miniatures, Bagchi\u2019s paintings on the fall of the Mughal empire depict its pathos. Hindu and Buddhist mythology featured prominently in his work, and he illustrated the Hindu epics Ramayana\u00a0and\u00a0Mahabharata, and the Buddhist Jataka tales, in miniature style. He also painted episodes from the works of the classical Sanskrit playwright Kalidasa, such as Kumarasambhavam, Meghadootam and Abhijnanashakuntalam.\nBagchi also did numerous oil portraits in which he applied Western concepts and techniques, though a strong Indian sensibility comes through in them. He received several awards in his career, including the President\u2019s medal for best exhibitor\u2019s prize at his alma mater, the President\u2019s gold and silver plaque at the All India Exhibition of Paintings, Madras, 1958, and a gold medal at the All India Exhibition, Patna, for traditional Indian paintings. He was commissioned by Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan, to paint a life-size oil of Rabindranath Tagore and his family in 1961.",

    "intro": "The Dutch artist Marius Bauer was born on 25 January 1867 at The Hague, the Netherlands, to a stage painter who encouraged his son\u2019s early interest in drawing.",
    "bio": "Bauer went on to study at The Hague\u2019s Royal Academy of Art under the direction of Jan Phillip Koelman but left without graduating as he found the teaching approach too conservative. However, he continued to study independently as he won several medals at the academy that earned him a stipend from King William III. \n Besides painting, Bauer also learnt etching and the Dutch master Rembrandt is often considered the inspiration for his etchings. With an active interest in the East largely due to the prevalent trend among the Dutch artists, Bauer decided to make orientalism his principal subject towards the end of 1880s, and made numerous trips to Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, India, Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia). \n Bauer first travelled to India in 1897-98 and arrived in Bombay, from where he travelled to Benaras, Agra, Gwalior, Mathura, Delhi, Bharatpur, Jaipur, Udaipur, Ajmer, Palitana, Baroda and Hyderabad. He visited India again in 1924-25 by when he had become a celebrated artist with exhibitions across European cities, and even in the U.S.A. \n In 1900, he was named a Ridder (a title of nobility in Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands) in the Order of the Orange Nassau (the reigning house of the Netherlands). King Albert I of Belgium awarded him the Order of the Crown in 1911 while in 1927, he was made a Ridder in the Order of the Netherlands. Bauer passed away in Amsterdam on 18 July 1932.",

    "intro": "An important artist of the Madras Group that synthesised modernism by melding Indian traditions with Western modernist techniques under the direction of K. C. S. Paniker, M. Suriyamoorthy\u2019s visual language employed emphatic regional and folk imagery.",
    "bio": "Born on 16 August 1944, Suriyamoorthy was an experimental artist known for unusual innovations\u2014he made paintings with the waters of various Indian rivers considered holy, and made colours by grinding seashells and medical ingredients left behind by his father who was a practitioner of the indigenous medical science of Siddha. In later years, he also worked in mixed media, oil and acrylic colours.\nPainting in the figurative tradition, Suriyamoorthy\u2019s canvases were a sm\u00f6rgasbord of traditional regional influences such as the Lepakshi murals, the kolam culture of making decorative patterns on floor with rice flour, textile motifs, and south India\u2019s plastic tradition. The female figure remained a constant muse, whether in the form of a deity or a middleclass housewife. Thematically, his animated compositions oscillated between domesticity, dance and music performances, vegetable and fruit sellers, marriage and ear-piercing ceremonies, the antics of a snake charmer, and iconic representations of the Hindu pantheon of gods. Dividing the space through geometric grids, he placed within it vignettes of pastoral life. His canvases were inscribed with the English script, reflecting the tradition of the Madras Art Movement.\nWinning the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award at the age of twenty-one, Suriyamoorthy remained active in Madras (now Chennai) until the late 1980s, after which he shifted to Singapore.",

W. Pearson. In 1916, he travelled with Rabindranath Tagore to Japan and studied Japanese painting. He then went to Chicago to study etching and became the first Indian to be elected a member of Chicago Society of Etchers. In 1920, he went to London to study at Slade School of Fine Art and the Royal College of Art. Choosing to root his work in the Orientalist matrix, Dey travelled extensively within India to observe people and architecture. Subjects from mythology engraved in dry point and hand coloured to add a sense of immediacy became his forte. He also executed portraits of contemporary luminaries.\nIn 1928, Dey became the first Indian principal of the Government School of Art, Calcutta, and actively promoted printmaking. He published books on his works, including My Pilgrimages to Ajanta and Bagh (1925) and My Reminiscences (1938). His autobiography, Amar Kotha, was published posthumously in 1995. He served as curator of the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, from 1956-58, and was elected fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, in 1987.

Mostly narrative and figurative, his paintings depicted life\u2019s pleasures and pains within a spiritual worldview.

He also brought out three sketch books in Bengali and produced a documentary on art for Doordarshan, Calcutta. Banerjee held fifty solo shows in India and abroad and served on the judging committee of many prestigious art institutions such as the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Academy of Fine Arts, and Rajya Charukala, all in Calcutta.",

He has experimented with colourful abstractions, sexual imagery, and figuration, responding as much to nature as to daily life and social issues. The women in his works are represented as nature spirits, plant forms, germinating seeds and allegorical figures, recalling mythological traditions.\nStage designer, art designer, actor and artist, Manu Parekh brings diverse perspectives to his work. Craft has been a long-term interest and association with the Weavers\u2019 Service Centre as a consultant designer gave him the opportunity to work with craftsmen. He has travelled widely across India studying the indigenous techniques and styles of folk artists.\nParekh received the President of India\u2019s silver plaque and the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society\u2019s award in 1972, and the national award of the Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi, in 1982. In 1992, he was honoured with the Padma Shri by the Government of India. His retrospective show at National Gallery of Modern Art also travelled to Mumbai and Bengaluru. He lives and works in New Delhi along with his artist wife, Madhvi Parekh.",

    "intro": "Full of fables from Madhvi Parekh's childhood, current environment and global consciousness, her paintings are unplanned, unfolding like a story where she adapts each work to the scale it demands, developing from a point into vast narratives.",
    "bio": "She was born and raised in Sanjaya, a village in Gujarat. Though she is self-taught and took up painting only in 1964, inspired by her artist-husband Manu Parekh, art remained a part of her consciousness through childhood memories, her family\u2019s rituals such as the traditional floor designs of rangoli, popular folk stories, and simple village life.\nWhile expecting their first child, Parekh\u2019s husband gifted her a book on drawing exercises by Paul Klee, and soon she was taking the first steps towards creating her own art vocabulary.\nApart from folk motifs, legends and figures, Parekh also uses imaginary characters in figurative and abstracted orientations, revealing the use of rhythm and repetition. Often, she utilises the settings of Kalamkari and Pichwai paintings where the main character of the composition sits in the centre with the minor or secondary ones filling the borders.\nIn the presence of dots, lines, circles and triangles, her paintings have been compared to those of Paul Klee, and in the presence of fantastical and bulbous creatures, to those of Joan Mir\u00f3. A documentary film on the Parekh couple, titled Dwity,\u00a0was made by Suraj Purohit in 1992. A retrospective on the artist that was held in New Delhi and Mumbai travelled to New York as well. The artist lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "bio": "She studied at the Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, under artist-teacher K. G. Subramanyan, receiving a post diploma in mural design.\nMukherjee worked with a range of mediums but it was the Fine Arts Fair at Baroda in the early 1970s that influenced her to explore woven sculptures and tapestry. Her painstakingly knotted hemp sculptures, and clay figures, with their twists, curves and overlapping layers, conveyed a feminist message through the body represented in fragments, but also of a lush, fecund world. She referred to her figure as an anthropomorphic deity, but the nature of her reverence was different as she stepped away from the norms of conventional iconography. In 2000, she started working in bronze, bringing the same organically-grown forms to this sturdy material as she did with hemp. She also used ceramic effectively in her work.\nMukherjee received the 1971 British Council scholarship in sculptural art and worked at West Surrey College of Art and Design, Farnham, England. Her works are in the permanent collections of National Gallery of Modern Art, Lalit Kala Akademi, both in New Delhi, and other reputed institutions.\nShe passed away in New Delhi on 2 February 2015 on the eve of her retrospective at National Gallery of Modern Art; this was followed by Met Breuer in New York honouring her with a retrospective in 2019.",

Naidu forsook Western modernism for images from Hindu mythology and religious iconography in the \u201970s\u2014a trend that had begun to show in his work in the previous decade\u2014rendered in free lines drawn with dry brush strokes. Notable were his works in the Mahabharata\u00a0series followed by\u00a0the Ramayana\u00a0and Musicians.

    "bio": "Born in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, on 17 September 1911, Husain came to Bombay in 1937 to become a painter, where he slept on footpaths and painted under streetlights. A self-taught artist, he began his career painting cinema posters and hoardings, and, in 1941, started making toys and furniture designs.\nHe imagined a secular language for modern Indian art that translated India\u2019s \u2018composite culture\u2019 into a rich mosaic of colours. As a member of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, launched in 1947, Husain heralded a new freedom for Indian art in the post-Independence decades. A peripatetic painter, Husain covered both geographical and conceptual territories, and transited at will between painting and poetry, assemblage and performance, installation and cinema. He experimented with text and images, and painted alongside musicians to translate music\u2019s elusiveness into the accuracy of brushstroke. His first film, a short film titled Through the Eyes of a Painter, won the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1967.\nHusain earned renown for his paintings of horses, though he became equally well-known for his series on Mother Teresa, or the British Raj, among others. His work reflected the relationship between generations of performers, and he referenced India\u2019s syncretic culture using motifs and figures imbued with mythological meaning to give them a modern makeover in keeping with prevalent art practices.\nHusain was awarded the Padma Shri in 1966, the Padma Bhushan in 1973, and the Padma Vibhushan in 1991 by the Indian government. Well into his nineties, he continued to paint despite living in exile in London and Dubai, having fled from India in 2006 following death threats and obscenity cases filed against him. He accepted Qatari citizenship in 2010 and passed away in London on 9 June 2011.",

    "intro": "Possibly the most popular academic Indian artist after Raja Ravi Varma, M. V. Dhurandhar was born in Kolhapur.",
    "bio": "An early interest in drawing led his father to admit him to Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, where he received special encouragement from its principal, John Griffiths.\nDhurandhar tasted early success with a gold medal from Bombay Art Society for his oil painting,\u00a0Have You Come Laxmi?\u00a0just as he completed his five-year course in 1895, becoming the first Indian to be awarded this prestigious medal. He continued to be associated with his alma mater, joining as a teacher soon upon graduation. At the end of an illustrious teaching career, he became the school\u2019s first Indian director in 1930.\nThe Abanindranath Tagore-led revivalist movement had taken hold of Bengal as a reaction to British academic dominance in the late nineteenth-early twentieth centuries. Bombay artists, on the other hand, were doing commissioned works that were academic in their rendering and technique but within an indigenous context, becoming known as history painters. Dhurandhar remained the most significant among them, maintaining a balance between academic realism and popular commercial art.\nThrough his prolific output, Dhurandhar chronicled contemporary society in his paintings and popular postcards. His well-known works include a series on Bombay and its people, scenes from Hindu mythology, illustrations for the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, among others. Otto Rothfeld\u2019s book Women of India, published in Bombay in 1920, was illustrated by Dhurandhar, as was Percival and Olivia Strip\u2019s The Peoples of India in 1944.",

    "bio": "His initial training was under his father, a Sanskrit scholar and painter, and he followed that up with formal study at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay. Abalal Rahiman, the court painter of Kolhapur state who had also trained at Sir J. J. School of Art, was a strong influence on Parandekar\u2019s art, and he achieved considerable expertise in drawing portraits and figures. However, his focus remained landscapes. He became one of the earliest modern Indian artists to paint Indian landscape in the outdoors, along with M. V. Dhurandhar, S. L. Haldankar, M. R. Acharekar, and others, with an intimacy that was lacking in the oeuvre of the European artists. His landscapes of the ghats of Nasik and the Mahalaxmi temple, Kolhapur, as well as the mountainscapes of Mahabaleshwar, were greatly admired by critics as well as art lovers in his time.\nParandekar\u2019s panoramic views of Indian archaeological sites, with their picturesque ambience, recall European masters in their use of perspective and three-dimensional effects. He acquired the patronage of Lord Willingdon, then governor of Bombay, as well as the maharaja of Patiala, who commissioned him to paint several projects. Parandekar played an important role in the foundation of the Art Society of India, and served as the secretary of the Archaeological Survey of India from 1920-30. He passed away in 1961.",

Memories of rites and rituals of his religious family that included an uncle who painted images of\u00a0Hindu\u00a0deities have remained an integral part of his vocabulary, as also the folk tales narrated to him in childhood by his mother\u2014as a young boy, he would admire the images of deities in the puja room of his home in Chengalpet near Madras. His lines, too, are drawn from kolam patterns, yantric diagrams, and geometric folk forms.\nA unique feature of Senathipathi\u2019s art is the transparent, stained-glass effect that he brings to his works. In the mid-1970s, he started working exclusively with pen and ink wash, immersing handmade paper in water before delineating his linear composition on it. The pressure of the nib or brush on wet paper gave rise to blots, smudges and sfumato effects, creating textures and enhancing the work\u2019s character.\nIn 1988, Senathipathi received a British Council grant to travel to different parts of Europe. Besides India, Senathipathi has exhibited in Poland, Germany, Malaysia, Holland, and Morocco. The artist lives and works in Chennai.",

He loved creating works of art but dreamt of becoming a lawyer, and therefore graduated in political science from Delhi University.\nHowever, he obtained a second bachelor\u2019s degree in graphics and painting from College of Art, New Delhi, in 1979, where he acquired skills in making linocuts, silkscreen prints, and the photographic process. Soon after graduation, Zharotia joined the National Institute of Open School (NIOS) in Delhi as graphics officer, from where he retired in 2012.\nHis pencil drawings from the 1980s became a source of fresh inspiration for his printmaking. Later, he worked on newer series around the theme of fantasy, using elements like the moon, trees and the rainbow, flying men and animals existing in a world where they transcend their quintessential attributes. In this, Zharotia was paying tribute to the wonder of the world and its creatures.\nA recipient of the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s research grant in 1989-90, Zharotia has participated in several national and international exhibitions. He won the Sahitya Kala Parishad award in 1981, and the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society award in 1991. The artist lives and works in New Delhi.",

    "bio": "Born in Dhuri, Punjab, he was encouraged by his brothers to pursue art and he studied at Delhi Polytechnic from 1958-63 under eminent artist-teachers Somnath Hore, Dhanraj Bhagat, B. C. Sanyal, and Abani Sen. He moved to England in 1964, where he worked as a silkscreen printmaker and studied at London School of Painting.\nUpon his return after eight years, he taught at his alma mater, Delhi\u2019s College of Art, from 1975-77, and began the discovery of his painterly identity. Not wishing to paint in an European-derived style, Bawa began exploring Indian mythology, folktales and love legends as themes for his work. His colour palette too was Indian, with vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, greens and blues providing the background for his works. Nature, birds and animals occurred frequently, along with the flute, suggesting the major Hindu deity, the flute-playing Krishna, or the tragic romantic hero Ranjha from the work of the eighteenth century Punjabi Sufi poet, Waris Shah.\nBawa established a silkscreen workshop at Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s Garhi Studios in New Delhi, achieving in his prints the same luminescent colours as his paintings. The 1984 anti-Sikh riots in Delhi saw him organise peace marches.  Bawa received the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1980, was awarded at the first Bharat Bhavan Biennale, Bhopal, in 1986, and received the Dayawati Modi annual award in 2000. He lived mostly in New Delhi, where he passed away on 29 December 2008.",

    "intro": "M.S. Joshi combined his training in academic realism with a sense of vitality, precision and aesthetics to reveal India\u2019s rich cityscapes and landscapes in his watercolour and gouache works.",
    "bio": "There was immense depth in the rendering of his subjects, which included people, places, architectural elements, all done in a subdued yet textured palette.\nBorn in Nashik, Maharashtra, he studied at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, in the 1930s. Regarded as an important educator, Joshi was one of the founding members\u2014and later principal\u2014of the Model Art Education Society and Institute, established in 1939 in Dadar, Bombay. He also took an active interest in Marathi theatre, directing dramas while also being involved with the stage settings and costumes.\nThe artist\u2019s works have rich texture, a rich palette of not just colour but also an artistic vision that is unique and individualistic.  A deeply profound visual aesthetic has allowed Joshi\u2019s art to be collected widely all over the world, and his works have been part of permanent collections in prestigious museums in the U.K., Australia, and Japan, among others.\nBetween the 1950s-70s, Joshi received several awards from the Bombay Art Society, Hyderabad Art Society, Mysore Dasarao Exhibition, All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, among others. In 1964, Joshi received the national award from the Lalit Kala Akademi.",

Despite Pakistani claims on his heritage, his contribution towards the entire subcontinent\u2019s art is substantial\u2014his subjects ranged from Buddhist themes, Hindu epics, stories from Radha-Krishna mythology, as well as illustrative paintings on Ghalib\u2019s poetry and the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.\nAs Pakistan\u2019s national artist, his publication,\u00a0Amal-i-Chughtai, and original works were gifted to visiting heads of states. He also designed postal stamps and insignia for Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television. He was awarded Pakistan\u2019s highest honours\u2014Hilal-i-Imtiaz in 1960, and the Presidential medal for the Pride of Performance in 1968. He passed away in Lahore on 17 January 1975.",

    "bio": "Born in Bombay, Samant showed early proficiency for both music and art. A lifelong player of sarangi\u2014an Indian bowed, string  instrument\u2014Samant chose painting as a career and obtained a diploma from Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, in 1952.\nThe development of Samant\u2019s primitivist modernism was accentuated by the unconventional mix of colours, crisp lines, sporadic textures, and figural stylisation. The visual language he adopted stemmed from a confluence of different faiths, ideas and cultures. He was fascinated by early art, especially ancient Egyptian art, and took ideas and elements from Mughal miniatures, Jain manuscript paintings, and tribal and folk symbolism in his work, fusing Hindu mythology and ancient Egyptian wall paintings with modern art. Samant\u2019s relief-like impasto and textures recall the rough surfaces of rocks or weather- beaten walls.\nLike the artists of the Art Brut movement, particularly Jean Dubuffet, he explored the excavated image through fissures and abandoned tracks of paint.\nSamant joined the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group in 1952 and won several prestigious awards throughout his career. In 1959, he went to New York on a John D. Rockefeller III Fund fellowship and stayed there till 1964; four years later he shifted to New York permanently, where he passed away in 2004.",

    "bio": "Born in 1918 in Jiaganj in Murshidabad, West Bengal, he sub-consciously absorbed the artistic ambience of Santiniketan where he grew up; his father was one of the earliest students at Kala Bhavana at the Visva-Bharati University. Dugar acquired art skills from his father and considered Santiniketan his alma mater. He was inspired by his father\u2019s mentor Nandalal Bose, who saw great promise in him.\nThe absence of academic training gave Dugar\u2019s art an individuality that distinguished him from other artists of Kala Bhavana. Dugar soon outgrew the Bengal School mannerisms, invariably visiting places to observe and paint views of nature and life en plein air. While he experimented with several mediums, his strength lay in executing delicate landscapes in watercolour. His mature works established him as one of the finest landscape painters of India. Progressively reducing naturalistic details in his paintings, he instinctively retained colour harmony for expressing serenity in nature.\nApart from landscapes, Dugar executed decorative motifs for several annual sessions of the Indian National Congress. He illustrated children\u2019s books and as an art critic wrote for Bengali journals\u00a0Desh\u00a0and\u00a0Ananda Bazar Patrika. A member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Calcutta, and All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society in New Delhi, Dugar\u2019s works were exhibited in Paris in 1946 and across West Germany in 1964. He passed away in 1989.",

    "bio": "Soon after, he began to travel to paint, beginning with South America, and then Egypt, Persia, and Morocco. \r\nIn 1874, Weeks shifted to Paris with his wife to train under French orientalists. Inspired by Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me of \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, he trained privately under L\u00e9on Bonnat. He soon emerged as the most important American artist of orientalism as he travelled extensively to paint visual chronicles of various Eastern cultures.\nIn 1882-83, Weeks travelled through India making several paintings of common people and royalty, becoming the first known American artist to come to India. Notable sketches and paintings done during this trip featured in his book, From the Black Sea through Persia and India. These included images of common scenes in British Indian cities such as Karachi (\u2018Kurrachee\u2019), Lahore, Amritsar, Benares, Mathura, and Agra.\nHe returned again to India in 1887, travelling extensively till 1893, choosing, this time, to go through the \u2018Rajpootana\u2019 and Malwa (present-day Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) to which he devoted multiple chapters in his book; with exhaustive details and prints of his paintings of various states of the \u2018Rajpootana\u2019.

    "intro": "Nandalal Bose drew his early philosophical inspiration from Ananda Coomaraswamy, Sister Nivedita and E. B. Havell, and also from the Japanese painters in Calcutta whose influence impressed upon him the significance of valuing one\u2019s artistic heritage.",
    "bio": "Hailing from Munger in Bihar, he was fifteen when he came to Calcutta to continue his education, where his passion for art ultimately took him to the Government College of Arts and Crafts, to be groomed by Abanindranath Tagore from 1905-10.Close association with the Tagores awakened his idealism for a nationalistic consciousness and commitment toward classical and folk art, along with its underlying spirituality and symbolism.\nWhen, in 1919, Bose was invited by Rabindranath Tagore to take charge of the newly-founded Kala Bhavana at his Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, he focussed mostly on the awakening of the creative potential of each student while laying emphasis on the unity of art and nature. In his own work, Bose experimented with the flat treatment of Mughal and Rajasthani traditions and played with the Sino-Japanese style and technique in his washes.\nThe 1930s saw a transition in his works from figuration to landscape. Engaging with various styles, Bose came up with a series of temperas marked by the impact of post-impressionist and expressionist renderings. His \u2018posters\u2019 for meetings of the Indian National Congress, and his illustrations, along with a group of other artists, of the Constitution of India, acknowledged his contribution to the creation of a new art for India.\nAwarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954, his works were declared a National Art Treasure under the Antiquities and Art Treasure Act 1972. Bose passed away in Calcutta on 16 April 1966.",

    "name": "Nataraj Sharma",
    "year": "b - 1958",
    "intro": "For a socially responsive artist like Nataraj Sharma, the frenzied pace of change in contemporary times coupled with his upbringing in vastly different cultural milieus of India, Egypt, England, and Zambia, has proved to be the proverbial grist for his art mill.",
    "bio": "An inter-disciplinary artist, Sharma was born in Mysore in 1958 and graduated in applied art from M. S. University, Baroda, in 1982. He expresses his observances of the socio-political and cultural dynamics around him through paintings, prints, installations, and digital art, in a vocabulary that is bold and individualised. Yet, one comes across the influence of Andy Warhol\u2019s pop art and Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Dadaism occasionally. Whether figure studies, portraits, landscapes in acrylic or oil, or large-scale installations, Sharma seems to be at ease with it all.\nUnrestrained construction activity across India in the past few decades has been an important trope in Sharma\u2019s art. By presenting dense vistas of residential and industrial construction activity devoid of human figures, he makes a stark, haunting comment on the soullessness of the enterprise, as also on the future of humankind based on such gargantuan activities. Often, he presents a mocking version of the world around him, thereby conveying harsh truths with a dollop of humour. The titles of his works are equally merciless as is evident from Hierarchical Arselickers (2003-04) or Adani Thermal Power Plant (2020).\nSharma has participated in several group shows and held solo shows in Delhi, Mumbai, Singapore and Geneva among other venues. The artist lives and works between Baroda and Goa.",

    "bio": "Born in an educator\u2019s family on 7 April 1934 in a small town in Gujarat, he studied to be a drawing teacher and began his career in Chanasma. He then joined the C. N. School in Ahmedabad for its five-year diploma course in art offered by Sir J. J. School of Art; simultaneously, he continued to study for his master\u2019s in teaching art.\nAs a twenty-seven-year-old, Bhavsar learnt about the possibilities of further education from a class fellow\u2019s father and enrolled at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art to study industrial design, but once there, changed course to study painting at the Tyler School of Art, Temple University. Here, he met Janet Brosious, an artist and art educator; they would later marry in 1978. In 1970, he had his first show at Max Hutchinson Gallery, New York.\nHis paintings invariably have an Indian title, linking his works closely to the land of his birth and youth, and they often address subjects or myths familiar to those from India\u2014whether in a literal or abstract sense. \u2018Bhavsar is at once a thoroughly American painter and product of Indian culture,\u2019 Carter Ratcliff, art writer, said of him. Well established and widely appreciated, Bhavsar lives and works in New York.",

    "bio": "Biswas was committed to bringing about technical innovations as well as transformations in contemporary artistic thought. After receiving his diploma from the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, in 1954, when the Indian art scene was in the midst of the abstract wave, Biswas proclaimed humanist preoccupations.\nHe worked as an illustrator for Bengali weeklies\u00a0Darpan\u00a0and\u00a0Janasebak Saptahik, searching for significant images to express the political and social turmoil of his time. The struggling artist also worked as an art teacher at Mitra Institute, a government school, for a living.\nThe bulk of Biswas\u2019s drawings emerged from his diaries which he used to maintain to keep up with his wide range of activities. His dark and mysterious figures embrace his iconic clown, a combating soldier, horses and women, and are done in thick black ink or fine lines. His human figures are expressed at the moment of mortal combat through which Biswas consistently tried to provide an outward dimension to the inner manifestation of pain.\nDespite a very short life span, the artist produced a large body of work, mostly black and white drawings on paper. His paintings were exhibited in Germany posthumously and are in the permanent collection of Halle Museum in Dresden, Germany.",

    "intro": "Born in Karachi, a year before it became part of Pakistan, Nalini Malani\u2019s art, unsurprisingly, is built on observing the struggles and strife of people, socio-political changes, and how she observes this.",
    "bio": "More recently, the lockdown in India on account of the corona pandemic and its impact on migrant workers has impacted her work, even prompting her to post short animations on social media platforms.\nMalani graduated from Sir J. J School of Art, Bombay, in 1969. Interestingly, she began experimenting with new media early in her career. In the same year that she graduated, Malani created a series of colour, stop-motion films called Dream Houses. Later, in the 1970s, studying in \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux Arts in Paris, Malani was able to gain a new perspective about her own motherland.\nLearning the technique of reverse painting from master artist Bhupen Khakhar in the \u201980s allowed her to understand how to create a strong sense of character in her figurative work. She did illustrations for The Times of India wherein she delved deeply into Indian mythology, and many of her works from the Stories Retold series probably reflect her days as an illustrator in the publication.\nAn internationally acclaimed artist, Malani\u2019s solo exhibitions have been held at most prestigious locations, including Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2016) and the Centre Pompidou in Paris\u2014the first living Indian artist to have a show there \u2014and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (both 2017), to name some. In 2020, Malani\u2019s installation, Can You Hear Me?, opened to the public at Whitechapel Gallery in London. The same year she became the first Indian to receive a two-year research fellowship in contemporary art awarded by London\u2019s National Gallery. The Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi, organised her retrospective across three shows in 2014.\nThe artist divides her time between Mumbai and Amsterdam, continuing to work actively from both cities.",

    "bio": "Just like James Boswell\u2019s biography of English writer Samuel Johnson is considered the finest in the language, Ghosh\u2019s photo-biography of his mentor is one of the finest photo essays on a legend\u2019s life; Ghosh was Ray\u2019s photographer from 1968 until Ray\u2019s death in 1992.\nBefore he picked up the lens, Ghosh was part of actor-director Utpal Dutt\u2019s Little Theatre in Calcutta and played the lead in the 1959 play, Angar. A moment of serendipity put him on the path he was destined for. A friend, who owed Ghosh Rs 240, found a Cannonette QL-16 fixed-lens camera left behind in a taxi. Instinctively, Ghosh wrote off the debt for the camera. Soon, he was introduced to Ray by the filmmaker\u2019s art director Bansi Chandragupta. Ray liked Ghosh\u2019s pictures and asked him to join his production unit in 1968. The rest, to use a clich\u00e9, is history.\nHis books include Satyajit Ray at 70 (1991) with a foreword by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Satyajit Ray: A Vision of Cinema (2005) in collaboration with Andrew Robinson, Manik-Da: Memories of Satyajit Ray (2011), Satyajit Ray and Beyond (2013), Faces and Facets: Ray in Colour (2020), the last two published by DAG. He has also photographed his beloved city extensively, and done a series on indigenous communities.\nGhosh\u2019s photographs have been widely exhibited in India and abroad and are in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2010. Ghosh passed away on 25 March 2020 in Kolkata.",

    "bio": "He was born in 1885 in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, and completed his early education at the Ratnagiri School of Industry. Here, he studied carpentry and drawing in 1906, before joining Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, for formal training in art. Thereafter, he began work as a drawing teacher in a school in Fort, Bombay. In 1915, he had a short stint as a drawing teacher at his alma mater too.\nHis watercolours show the influence of Sir J. J. School principal Cecil Burns who excelled in transparent watercolours and helped popularise the medium. Sardesai won the 1927 and 1929 Bombay Art Society\u2019s annual exhibition awards for his paintings The Indian Beauty, and High Expectations.\nLike other artists of the period such as Abalall Rahiman, M. V. Dhurandhar, and, later, S. L. Haldankar, Sardesai was part of a growing trend among artists of western India from the late nineteenth century, of painting outdoors. Sardesai\u2019s paintings chart and represent the nation\u2019s physical vistas through its rivers, temples, and monuments. Well-known for his figurative paintings as well, Sardesai\u2019s subjects are rendered with finesse and amazing clarity of details. His portraits carry an unpretentious realism that faultlessly capture the subject\u2019s ordinariness, raising them to extraordinariness.",

    "bio": "Born in Gujarat to a family of farmers, he grew up making clay toys as part of playing with village children. He joined the painting course at Faculty of Fine Arts, M. S. University, Baroda, but eventually switched to sculpture, which he found less daunting than painting. He obtained an M.F.A. in sculpture in 1964 and in the same year won a travelling scholarship from the Government of India, which allowed him to visit quarries across the country and interact with stone carvers.\nA unique characteristic of Patel\u2019s sculptures is his part-polished, part-rough aspects of stone, inspired by historical sculptures at Badami and Mahabalipuram where some parts have acquired a polished feel due to centuries of being touched by people\u2019s hands, while the rest of the work remains in its natural state.\nCarving was Patel\u2019s preferred process as he enjoyed the sensuousness of marble, the warmth of sandstone, and the tactile texture of granite and wood. To his printmaking too, Patel brought a sculptural effect.\nHe won many honours, such as the Gujarat state award in 1962-64, the Lalit Kala Akademi national award in 1976, the Gaurav Puraskar in 1997, and Aditya Vikram Birla Kala Shikhar Puraskar in 2011. His sculptures are installed at Seoul Olympic Park, Korea, Arandjelovac, Serbia, the Noguchi Museum in Japan, and several places in Baroda, where he built his career. \r\nHe passed away on 17 December 2017.\nHe passed away on 17 December 2017.",

These paintings remain some of the best works celebrating the mighty mountain range.\nRoerich was born on 9 October 1874 in St. Petersburg in a well-to-do family that often entertained the city\u2019s cultural set. He studied law and drawing simultaneously and soon came in contact with Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the renowned Ballets Russes. Designing sets and costumes for the group\u2019s productions, he toured Europe with Diaghilev, and came in touch with Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall, and Wassily Kandinsky, who were also designing sets for Diaghilev.\nRoerich immigrated to the United States in 1920 with wife Helena, where he founded the Agni Yoga Society the same year in New York, and an art institute the next year which would metamorphose into the Nicholas Roerich Museum in 1949. Around this time, Roerich started on a quest to explore the Eastern philosophies that had begun to impact his work.\nThis quest brought him to India in 1923 and he extensively explored the Himalayas from Sikkim in the east to Ladakh and Kashmir in the north-west. He also travelled through large parts of Central Asia and South Asia as part of his Asian expeditions, and was instrumental in creating the Roerich Peace Pact for the safekeeping of cultural and artistic legacies.\nRoerich established the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute in 1928 in Kullu valley and passed away on 13 December 1947 in Naggar, Himachal Pradesh. His home there is now a museum.",

She has travelled extensively across continents in her quest for empowering people; through her art, her writings, and films, she has addressed a variety of issues\u2014social inequality, political repression, gender, and sexuality. In the 1970s, she was also associated with the Progressive Youth Movement (Proyom). Navjot maps the trajectories of memory, history and culture, interrogating \u2018body politics\u2019, seeing the self as a source of knowledge. She articulates her own experience to address issues related to the social, the political, and the artistic.\nIn 1997, she met tribal artists from Bastar in central India, viz., Rajkumar Korram, Shantibai, and Gessuram Vishwakarma, and founded Dialogue Interactive Artists Association to create a ground for dialogue between tribal and urban artists to work side-by-side. They have created many artistic projects in collaboration since then.\nNavjot brings her wide experience and exposure to her craft, having travelled and shown her work extensively and gained from art practices in England, Brazil, Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, and U.S.A. She explores various materials and mediums in her work.\nShe married fellow artist Altaf in 1972 and the two held several joint exhibitions till his passing in 2005. Navjot continues to live and work in Mumbai.",

    "intro": "Master printmaker Harendra Narayan Das, popularly known as Haren Das, worked almost exclusively in printmaking at a time when oil painting ruled popular consciousness and prints were considered inferior.",
    "bio": "Born in Dinajpur in present day Bangladesh on 1 February 1921, Das took a diploma in fine art, with specialisation in graphic arts, from the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Calcutta, in 1938. Upon graduation, he joined his alma mater as a lecturer and soon introduced line engraving and etching in the college\u2019s curriculum.\nHis works included engravings, linocuts, etchings, and lithographs but he especially excelled in woodcuts. Taken from densely engraved or sparsely cut wood blocks, his prints are both technically and artistically superior. A dexterously crafted equilibrium of black and white, at times washed with thin layers of colour, detailed renditions of objects and elements, simplicity of composition and petite format characterise his prints. No viable art market existed in India till the 1960s, with few takers for prints in its narrow horizon. Das, however, continued with his passion, exhibiting extensively in India and abroad.\nDas\u2019s career flowered at a time of great political and social turbulence in India, especially in his native Bengal. Yet, he turned to rural Bengal\u2019s idyllic life, perhaps as a respite. In chronicling vignettes from countryside in his prints, documenting people\u2019s daily lives, Das recorded a reality of the times that was easily overshadowed by concurrent epochal events. He passed away in Calcutta in 1993.",

    "bio": "A notable artist of the rebel Jubilee Art School that trained students in the British academic style, breaking away from Abanindranath Tagore\u2019s Orientalist emphasis, Mazumdar was born on 19 September 1894 to a landowning family in Kishoreganj in present day Bangladesh. He studied art against his father\u2019s wishes and went on to become the most sought-after artist for oil portraits after Raja Ravi Varma.\nIn 1920, along with Atul Bose and Jamini Roy, Mazumdar founded the influential illustrated journal, Indian Academy of Art, as a platform for academic artists from all over India, and to counteract the dominance of Bengal School journal, Rupam. Though Roy soon moved away from academic realism, and Bose left for England, Mazumdar\u2019s career took off. He went on to win three gold medals from the respected Bombay Art Society.\nHis large oils of women in the nude or draped in diaphanous clothes, bearing an air of voyeuristic eroticism, won him several commissions from the maharajas of Jaipur, Bikaner, Kashmir, Patiala, and other princely states. Most commonly, a single woman is seen in these works in wet drapery and idealised romantic settings, emphasising her sensuous appeal.\nAt the All India Exhibition in Calcutta in 1948, the last show he participated in, Mazumdar presented rural Bengal life in his works with amazing realism, a far cry from his earlier work. He passed away on 22 July that year.",

University, Baroda, and was associated with the Baroda Group of Artists that was formed in 1956.\nShah's international breakthrough came in 1967-68, when he spent a year in the U.S. supported by the John D. Rockefeller III Fund, co-curating the exhibition, \u2018Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village\u2019, with Stella Kramrisch of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In subsequent years, he would curate several exhibitions in India and abroad on tribal and folk art and rituals, and Indian textiles, writing/co-authoring many related books, such as Rural Craftsmen and Their Work with Dr. Eberhard Fischer in 1970.\nShah\u2019s anthropological endeavours impacted him as an artist, as he revisited tribal art forms and folk themes in his work, repeating images of cows, trees, and human figures with a quiet force. He also painted a series on the poetry of medieval poet-saints like Kabir, Mirabai, and Rai Das.\nIn 1989, he received the Padma Shri and also set up Shilpa Gram in Udaipur for the revival of arts and crafts.

Another uncle, Joseph Singleton, exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, as did his sisters Sarah and Maria, who were trained miniaturists.\nShowing talent for drawing and painting early in life, Singleton exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1780, a drawing that he had made when he was only ten. He entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1783, winning a silver medal in 1784 and a gold medal in 1788. From 1784, he exhibited at the Royal Academy every year till his death on 15 September 1839, showcasing nearly 300 works in all.\r\nSingleton was a prolific and a versatile artist, who earned fame for his portraits, depiction of battle scenes, as also for religious, mythological, historical, Shakespearean and other literary subjects that he painted with great felicity. Many of his works were subsequently engraved.\nHe never travelled to India but worked as a propaganda painter recreating images of English victory in the subcontinent. His works are in the collections of the London institutions such as British Museum, Victoria & Albert Museum,  National Portrait Gallery, Royal Institution, and Tate Britain, as also in Edinburgh\u2019s Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and Ulster Museum in Belfast.",

Adopting and promoting European techniques and modes in sculpture and creating strongly academic works, he worked across a variety of mediums, such as bronze and terracotta.\nHe was an influential teacher who taught at the Government College of Arts and Crafts, Lucknow, and mentored several eminent sculptors such as D. P. Roy Chowdhury, and later Prodosh Das Gupta. Sudhir Ranjan Khastgir, who eventually earned renown for his paintings, too studied under Roychaudhuri at Lucknow.\nA close friend of the Tagores, Roychaudhuri was an important member of the Indian Society of Oriental Art and participated in all its early exhibitions along with contemporaries such as Nandalal Bose, Asit Kumar Haldar, K. Venkatappa, Kshitindranath Majumdar, and Surendranath Ganguly.\nWhile in England, he wrote a letter to Haldar complaining of English art aesthetics being too \u2018literal\u2019. The letter was reprinted in the Bengali magazine Bharati to triumphant declarations of an emergent Orientalism. Along with Haldar, Roychaudhuri produced plaster maquettes for four panels based on Nandalal Bose\u2019s cartoons that were sent to London in 1912 to be cast in bronze.",

    "name": "Hemanta Misra",
    "year": "1917 - 2009",
    "intro": "One of the pioneers of surrealism in Indian modern art, Hemanta Misra was born in Sivasagar, Assam, on 13 October 1917.",
    "bio": "Misra went to school in his hometown and later studied at Cotton College, Guwahati, and St. Edmund\u2019s, Shillong. As for the arts, he was self-taught, polishing his skills through a correspondence course with British artist John Hassal.\nMisra shifted to Calcutta early in his career, the first phase of which was marked by brilliant landscapes evoking his native Assam. Landscapes gave way to experiments with cubism. However, his cubism was not a copy of the West but its distillation, with angles being softer and compositions more lyrical. Misra traversed a wide range of pictorial styles before arriving at a consistent and personal vocabulary defined by intuitive surrealism,.\nIn 1947, he was the art advisor to the \u2018First Assam Hills and Plains People\u2019s Exhibition\u2019, and worked as a staff artist in the military. On the strength of his drawing, he was selected as member of the prestigious Calcutta Group of artists in 1953. Misra was also a writer and a poet, and illustrated several books. His publications include the Assamese book Bharatiya Chitrakala (1978), a book of poems in Assamese titled Roopar Antare Roop (1984), and the Bengali book Dikhow Luit O Sagar (1990). His works are in the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, and the State Museum of Oriental Art, Moscow.\nHe passed away in Guwahati on 31 December 2009.",

    "name": "Hugo Vilfred Pedersen",
    "year": "1870 - 1959",
    "intro": "Danish artist Hugo Vilfred Pedersen was born on 25 January 1870 in Copenhagen, where he studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts before heading to the East on painting expeditions.",
    "bio": "Pedersen spent about twenty years travelling through Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India, making copious paintings of the sights that he saw, and portraits of the important personages he met.\nPedersen\u2019s older brother worked on a tobacco plantation in Sumatra, where he first arrived in 1898, travelling further to Penang, Java, and Siam. He painted many portraits of native subjects, which he clearly found interesting. These included a portrait of the ruler of Surakarta in Java, in whose palace Pedersen worked briefly, thanks to an introduction by the Dutch governor general of the colony. This portrait was subsequently presented as a token of the ruler\u2019s loyalty to the Queen of the Netherlands; it continues to be a part of the Royal Dutch Collection.\nPedersen especially sought out the ordinary folk, painting portraits of liveried servants, guards and other support staff of the colonial empire who often lived in total obscurity. One such striking portrait is that of a Sikh bodyguard in the service of the Maharajah of Burdwan. Pedersen also painted a portrait of India\u2019s Viceroy of the time, Lord Curzon, in 1903, which perhaps attests to his presence at the Delhi Durbar the same year.\nEight of Pedersen\u2019s paintings were published in 1926 in Peeps at Many Lands, edited by J. F. Scheltema. The artist passed away on 4 May 1959.",

    "year": "1917 - 2001",
    "intro": "A founder member of the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group, Hari Ambadas Gade was born in Amravati, Maharashtra, in 1917.",
    "bio": "In his own words, he had a \u2018compelling interest in science and mathematics\u2019, as a result of which he graduated in science. However, he started making landscapes while on a visit to Jabalpur; subsequently, S. H. Raza guided him on the nuances of landscape painting. Gade eventually obtained a masters from the Nagpur School of Art in 1950.\nIn the corpus of Indian art, Gade stands distinct as a pioneering abstract expressionist and a painter of landscapes of un-peopled houses. He travelled every few months to capture the diverse scenery of India in his work. Gradually, he switched from watercolours\u2014with which he had begun painting landscapes\u2014to oil. His vocabulary also expanded to incorporate the changing landscape of Bombay with its growing slums, unplanned, rambling structures, and eventually veered towards abstraction.\nGade\u2019s urbanscapes are remarkable for their flat, chromatic intensity. The simple geometry of shapes represents a distant view of a densely built area in the city, with the dark heaving lines holding the structure of elemental shapes together. Besides his celebrated abstracts, Gade\u2019s oeuvre covered still-lifes, nudes, portraits, and landscapes.\nHe exhibited widely in India and abroad, including the Venice Biennale in 1954, and was a recipient of several awards such as the gold medal of the Bombay Art Society in 1956, the Maharashtra State Exhibition Award, and an award at the Saigon Biennale in 1962. He passed away in 2001.",

    "intro": "Born in Lothal in Gujarat, one of the most important sites of the Harappan civilisation (3300-1300 BCE), Himmat Shah\u2019s long-term engagement with terracotta traces its roots to the ancient antecedents of his birthplace, seen especially in his sculptural Heads.",
    "bio": "As a young boy, Shah studied in Bhavnagar at Gharshala\u2014a school associated with nationalist renaissance in Gujarat\u2014where he was initiated into arts by artist-educator Jagubhai Shah. Going against the grain of his Jain mercantile family, he studied at Sir J. J. School of Art, Bombay, and then at M. S. University, Baroda (1956-60). He went to Paris in 1967 for two years on a French government scholarship, studying under printmakers S. W. Hayter and Krishna Reddy at Atelier 17. This sojourn helped him interact with European modernism.\nA versatile artist, Shah has experimented across forms and mediums, making burnt paper collages, architectural murals, drawings, and sculptures in terracotta and bronze, though he sees himself primarily as a sculptor. His self-designed tools and innovative techniques give his preferred medium\u2014terracotta\u2014a contemporary edge. Shah uses a number of hand tools, brushes and instruments to carve, shape and mould his works. He has designed and executed monumental murals in brick, cement, and concrete.\nA founder member of Group 1890, Shah won the Lalit Kala Akademi\u2019s national award in 1956 and 1962, the Sahitya Kala Parishad award in 1988, and the Kalidasa Samman from the Madhya Pradesh government in 2003. He lives and works in Jaipur.",
